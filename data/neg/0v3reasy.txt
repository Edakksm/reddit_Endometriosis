TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 18:56:51 2018|221|Thats a tough spot to be in My heart goes out to you Not sure what to say to help but it sounds like youve got your head screwed on pretty straight Try not to get bogged down in their shit I had some tough times with my dad and it was always helpful for me to remember that parents are just people theyre not perfect but you only get the ones you have As a parent i cant imagine what a childs suicide mist do to you But this is about you not them Ultimately you taking sides or not wont affect their divorce much Is there one youd rather live with Try to keep your wits about you teenage years are hard enough without that extra helping of shit youve got to deal with But youll get through it and things will be easier with time In the mean time maybe theres other stuff you can try to focus on If you focus on your studies maybe you can land yourswlf a scholarship to help you get out on your own in a few years time or maybe you could find a hobby to help you stay positive and focused on something Exercise would probably be good for that or maybe some club at school All the best kiddo

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 21:38:27 2018|32|Depends if you were committed or if feelings are involved If theres no committment you cant cheat but if feelings are involved than it still may not have been the best decision 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 13 18:38:44 2018|104|Not sure how to tell you to get over the insecurities but as a guy i can tell you that a womans body is only part of the equation Personality is the most important part of sexiness A girl can be a perfect 10 but if the personality sucks than shes much less attractive than an average girl with an awesome personality Also confidence is sexy Not sure if it would help but exercise can make you feel more confidant and that might help with the other stuff youre talking about as well As an aside why mention cisgendered Isnt it kind of irrelevant
