relationships|Mon Feb 19 06:36:25 2018|493|Oh boy does this bring back memories This happened to my SO and I four years ago Our life was rocky at the time We had just had a baby were living with MIL and teenage SIL SO s ex was causing grief about stepson Also we were tight on money both had personal issues getting in the way of our relationship you get the picture So this second pregnancy came out of nowhere We were happy at first and for a few days were riding high but SO told me a week later she didn t want to have another baby She sat me down and very calmly explained all of the negatives we were facing It really hurt me because never in a million years did I envision myself having that conversation After 2 days I finally agreed because she did make sense and yes it was the right decision at the time but I felt she was holding something back wasn t being completely honest with me We get the abortion go back to our daily lives but this haunted me every second I tried talking to my SO about how I was feeling about a month afterwards where you are now and that conversation didn t end well for me She didn t comfort me as well as I needed At least that s how it felt We didn t speak of it again for about a year and it just featured in my mind I kept my thoughts and emotions from my SO the whole time I d cry uncontrollably when she wasn t home Friends and family noticed I d become distant I made a huge mistake by trying to find an emotional relationship with someone else bad stuff It all came to a head one night about 2 years ago I was drunk screamed at SO about how I felt completely neglected and how I mourned our child This was particularly a sore spot because I know in my heart it was going to be a boy I ve always wanted a boy but anyways yeah Next day I m sobbered up SO sits me down Tells me yes there was another reason she didn t want to be pregnant Said she didn t want to get fat and unfit I had already figured that out but her confirming it out loud was the final piece I needed to come to terms with our decision It took me a long time to accept what happened It was the right decision for us at the time There was no way we could have afforded another pregnancy or another child in such a small house The only thing is change about that time was that I would have liked more emotional support from my SO It appears you are providing that keep up the good work Let your SO know that time will heal that sense of loss
