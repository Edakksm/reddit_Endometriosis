relationships|Sat Jul 28 21:12:20 2018|200|I haven t confronted her yet The two of us have been so happy and healthy around each other that part of me is feeling I should just be trusting her Really if the back and forth texting wasn t happening everything would be picture perfect I know she loves me dearly she supports me completely in everything I do We spend our evenings talking and laughing together we share very common interests and our sex life is perfect Just the other day the bagging guy in our local supermarket stopped her to tell her that the two of us are the best couple he s seen and that we re so lucky to be together and all he s ever seen is us goofing around buying groceries She messaged me straight after all gushey about the experience I have very little doubt this dude is interested in more than friendship with her and I d imagine this will come up in conversation between us soon enough For now I m trying to focus a little on myself being the best person I can be and being the confident fun guy that she wants to be around more than anyone
