TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 05:00:25 2018|25|That s really good advice I have never thought about going about it this way Thank you so much I definitely will go that route 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 04:38:51 2018|54|It s okay Thank you for clarifying It definitely sounds like you had been studying hahah with all the facts you pulled out I think we could have a nice conversation about it but I might end up letting it go if she doesn t bring it up again Thank you for your input 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 04:29:02 2018|76|It s an ignorant stereotype I also have a booty and I guess have experienced something like it but I still think she is just ignorant doesn t realize it I think she kind of actually likes to think of it that way It in someway pleases her that s my problem with it I agree though it could go south which is a reason I was just wondering if I should say something at all 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 04:22:16 2018|24|I think I m going to next time No lecture intended I just want her to know it s ignorant to say Thank you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 04:20:23 2018|79|I get what you re saying but nowhere in my post did I say anything about reporting her to my boss or to anyone I just wanted to one on one say something to her in a polite manner Also you don t know anything about my boss I m confused as to why you went so deep into something that wasn t even mentioned I agree with your statements but I think maybe you read the post wrong
