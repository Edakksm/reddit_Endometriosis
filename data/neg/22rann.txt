TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 14:44:47 2018|27|It s not tricky The person is regretting it If she really wanted to have sex she would ve initiated it What is wrong with you people 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 14:43:50 2018|19|Sounds like a lot of mental gymnastics to say that you have to sell people to sleep with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 14:16:37 2018|29|Such a fucking cop out Pay off This is the problem How dumb a person can you be to ignore that someone who is hesitant might regret it afterwards

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 23:14:11 2018|5|Your sincere opinion is bad 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 21:33:45 2018|31|This is about you though really Embrace the things you enjoy and make those a priority and the rest will fall in line Or just go to the bar a lot 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 21:21:08 2018|45|Okay so in my mind a former restaurant critic that loves the paranormal and dabbles in tarot is 100x more interesting than someone who is a good person and likes to hang out with friends Do you see what I m getting at Sort of 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 21:11:01 2018|63|Now you re getting somewhere with the paranormal stuff and the tarot and the cooking Would you consider yourself a foodie Or just like cooking Personal finance investing is a good thing to be interested in but that s not something you re probably gonna bond with someone over Like that s something people talk about but typically wouldn t bring people together

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 20:38:03 2018|64|Just seems the stuff you listed that defines you is mostly stuff that s not unique at all It has nothing to do with your personality even It s quite literally the on paper stuff but I m sure there s more to you Imagine if someone had to describe you to someone else using those traits you listed It would tel them nothing 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 20:02:02 2018|15|Do you surround yourself with other people that focus on the job clothes and clubs 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 19:59:00 2018|40|I would say focusing on the on paper like clothes and what other people might like could essentially be the problem Find things you like to do on your own that don t have anything to do with others perceptions 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 19:54:00 2018|19|Are you trying too hard Wearing cool street wear shouldn t have anything to do with any of this
