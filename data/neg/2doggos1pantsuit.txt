TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 22:07:06 2018|9|Lazy coworkers expecting non lazy coworkers to offer help 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 21:41:58 2018|11|I don t think marketing is an excuse for being patronizing 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 21:26:21 2018|10|I think it s pretty patronizing to fat women honestly 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 21:25:42 2018|52|Eh no It is not exactly a difficult task to call all women real women It s more of a damned if you imply that a certain body type makes a woman real and not damned if you don t quantify a woman s realness by their measurements Not exactly rocket science 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 04:49:16 2018|14|Everyone s body reacts differently to things like that Glad it worked for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 00:36:24 2018|57|It s a stupid phrase and anyone who calls you that unironically isn t worth your time Chances are the minute you do anything outside of the realm of what he perceives you to be he will say You re not who I thought you were and try to make you feel bad about it Hard pass 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 00:12:21 2018|11|That s not her fault so stop penalizing her for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 00:04:03 2018|31|She s getting the procedure done whether you pick her up or not So I m not sure what you think you re going to accomplish by being petty about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 23:59:43 2018|41|Your opinion on her ears appearance is completely irrelevant They make her uncomfortable and she is taking the steps to feel better about them There s absolutely no reason why you shouldn t be willing to give her a ride home 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 22:38:02 2018|34|The fact that the link she provided was in a state where the law has allowed for public breastfeeding for quite a while shows that socially it hasn t made much of an impact 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 22:22:50 2018|70|Oh yea I mean I know people change I just think it s incredibly stupid for a person who had a past of doing things like that to not revisit his comments and address how messed up they were before being called out for it Apologizing after the fact just makes it seem like he didn t think they were all that bad up until people took issue with them 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 22:02:03 2018|62|You get to choose where you draw the line but I m telling you right now if you cut off anyone who does or says something that offends you you re going to isolate yourself Saying or doing something slightly sexist doesn t mean someone hates women Hell even feminists occasionally have a misstep in which they show some form of sexism 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 21:54:45 2018|24|No one is perfect 100 of the time If you judge people on tiny missteps you will never find anyone you can be around 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 21:52:41 2018|3|So Lilith Fair 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 21:51:49 2018|28|I mean seriously he could have just deleted them Kinda stupid for him to just leave them out in the open when he got hired on by Disney 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 21:47:27 2018|26|Harmless I don t think so I mean he was working for a company that caters to kids published child rape jokes are terrible for PR 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 20:48:14 2018|22|That s nice but I m not sure what that has to do with the states in which it wasn t legal 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 17:12:33 2018|11|Working on a food truck owning and running a food truck 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 17:11:54 2018|110| Would the event be inherently unorganized if run by a 15 year old I mean probably A 15 year old single handed you running an event would 9 time s out of 10 turn out poorly It s hard enough as an adult kudos to you for doing it his comment implies that women teenagers are incapable of organizing an event efficiently It implies that teenagers are incapable of it and it implies that he knew the organizer was female He could very well be a sexist asshat but that s a jump to make He felt you were not organized It happens If everyone else was happy who cares 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 16:59:54 2018|19|You can ask her parents what her play preferences are and then pick something that goes along with that 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 16:48:28 2018|29|Sounds like an underhanded insult about food truck owners Which is odd since it generally takes a lot of drive hard work and commitment to run a food truck 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 16:27:13 2018|51|I dunno I think it was pretty clear he was unhappy with the how organized the event was Maybe he was being an ass but from experience I know how frustrating it is to be involved in an event where I perceive the organizer has no idea what they re doing 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 16:24:32 2018|38|Judging by the question and answer it sounds like he felt the event was disorganized like it was run by a teenager I dunno if that has to do with your gender so much as your organizational skills 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 16:09:13 2018|36|Antibiotics are not Available OTC due to the risk big problem of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria Overusing antibiotics is dangerous As far as your comparison with yeast infection medication yeast isn t treated with antibiotics 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 16:07:23 2018|7|Teenagers sure can be a buncha dicks 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 14:56:40 2018|12|Yea legal Like it wasn t legal before and now it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 14:52:59 2018|43|Oh totally I just don t think not being able to publicly breastfeed in only two states most recently is the reason why women chose choose not to breastfeed so it s not really going to make a noticeable difference in that realm 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 14:13:04 2018|7|Probably considered indecent exposure or some such 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 14:09:28 2018|12|I didn t realize it wasn t but that s good news 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 13:55:38 2018|33|She didn t really give consent to begin with though so there wasn t really anything to take away I wouldn t call it rape but he definitely didn t respect her boundaries 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 06:31:32 2018|23|Uh no need to reverse the genders bro everyone who responded told her that he isn t obligated to perform any sex acts 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 06:26:38 2018|18|Women should discuss with their doctor what is and isn t appropriate to eat during their specific pregnancy 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 06:06:16 2018|14|That doesn t really address what I said but yea I agree with that 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 05:54:24 2018|17|Because he s allowed to say no to whatever sexual activities he isn t comfortable participating in 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 05:15:50 2018|19|Everyone loses fat differently though If she loses ten pounds it may not be noticeable in that problem area 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 03:45:57 2018|1|Ouch 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 02:48:57 2018|11|Give it more than one day and put in some effort 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 02:47:14 2018|6|They re obviously joking mildly trolling 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 00:22:05 2018|4|Why are you terrified 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 00:18:20 2018|7|Looks like their reactions were pretty similar 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 00:16:58 2018|2|Good point 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 23:09:45 2018|5|The roadrunner has a vagina 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 23:08:12 2018|24|What 3 nights in a row of not feeling like having sex doesn t mean someone doesn t want to have sex at all 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 22:08:55 2018|58|My guess is that the guy wouldn t really care enough about her bumper sticker if he even noticed it to be uncomfortable about it He s a married dude with a kid Chances are he doesn t really give a hoot about the political opinions of some young person who happens to sit near him at work 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 22:02:34 2018|17|You don t have to be friends with him He s your coworker How old are you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 22:01:47 2018|100|OP does bring up a decent point though If you are in a relationship and know sex is on the table someday how often is appropriate to check in with your partner and see if they re ready Some may say you should wait for them to bring it up but there are a lot of people that don t feel comfortable ever bringing it up even when they do want to have sex It s hard because the only answer is it varies from relationship to relationship but legally it doesn t Someone either consented or they didn t 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 21:54:36 2018|34|You can t be friendly with him anymore because of a bumper sticker on his car that displays an opinion you dislike I don t think he s the person with a problem here 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 21:51:09 2018|12|No people are allowed to have opinions you don t agree with 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 20:23:03 2018|27|I wouldn t really rely on cartoons or Adam Sandler movies to give accurate depictions of life regardless of the gender of the person who wrote it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 20:18:46 2018|7|Just a symptom of a bigger problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 20:13:39 2018|41|I honestly can t think of any show that has portrayed a woman getting kicked in the vagina but I m interested now in seeing how they depict the reaction Where have you seen it I must watch it sounds ridiculous 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 20:12:04 2018|18| I know next to nothing about this topic Then maybe we don t need your input about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 14:56:20 2018|1|OK 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 14:25:53 2018|26|I have to ask do you agree with the things you post or do you just post every article you see that belongs on this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 05:06:46 2018|17|Yes you can You just press enter between lines instead of having a huge run on paragraph 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 29 04:36:44 2018|4|Please format your post 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 11:16:39 2018|9|Nope you must have missed my ninja edit Bye 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 11:14:36 2018|42|For this sub that would depend on the mod s on duty as well as whether or not the user who gets her accounts suspended every day is active and how many accounts she has used to report what she disagrees with 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 11:08:03 2018|26|I have read numerous comments that have subsequently been removed Some are awful and some just don t fit the narrative that they want to push 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 06:01:12 2018|89|Basically it seems like almost anything that gets reported ends up getting removed and there are a few people here that just report everything they disagree with I made a post on Father s Day asking women to share their good stories and experiences with their fathers and they removed it because it wasn t relevant I m not sure what isn t relevant about women sharing their experiences but I guess if it doesn t involve being molested or raped it s not relevant enough to be here 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 05:24:03 2018|23|I actually think r askmen is pretty balanced with its variety of mindsets all things considered It s one of my favorite subs 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 23:34:56 2018|29|I don t want a malevolent sexist and I have yet to meet a non annoying man who identifies as feminist so I ll go with benevolence any day 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 18:30:12 2018|10|Because the person I am responding to said drunk women 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 18:17:15 2018|30|That s not entrapment unless you re implying that they re tricking men into having sex with women who are too drunk to consent In which case that s bullshit 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 17:52:43 2018|31|I don t really think it s entrapment I d like you to expand on your choice to use that word I do think both sexes benefit and suffer from it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 17:31:27 2018|3|It is sexism 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 16:47:05 2018|42| A disadvantage with the new law might be that people who should have been charged or convicted of rape would end up being charged or convicted with the new lesser charge That s the disadvantage of this law they chose to highlight 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 16:34:02 2018|8|Yea it s very painful for some people 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 15:41:48 2018|14|Not really sure what you re trying to argue anymore Have a Good Friday 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 15:28:18 2018|15|No avoid going to sites that literally breed that kind of idiocy Like I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 14:48:53 2018|55|OP is talking about reading stuff online and then applying it to the people she meets IRL not actual IRL interactions And yea idiots aren t 100 avoidable but going to sites that literally breed that kind of idiocy is her own personal choice There is absolutely no reason she has to be on Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 13:18:56 2018|23|Chances are it s just a phase As long as he keeps showing love and affection eventually they ll grow out of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 13:15:42 2018|13|I fucking hope not She doesn t need to be associated with Democrats 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 06:42:10 2018|34|You should not read things on Reddit if it bothers you that much I was bothered by comments on articles and on Facebook so I stopped reading them and that was a great choice 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 01:46:23 2018|2|I do 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 00:54:51 2018|14| any reason you would say he sounds like an idiot I read your post 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 00:50:35 2018|11|I would break up with him He sounds like an idiot 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 00:48:20 2018|38|Squats are just going to build muscle They re not going to take away fat from the areas where you are prone to accumulate fat You d have to lose that fat to see any change in things 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 00:46:46 2018|1|Yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 00:09:03 2018|6|It prevents ovulation or implantation ideally 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 23:58:38 2018|10|Or she was doing it to open her own gym 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 23:50:42 2018|12|Did she give any indication that she was forced into sex work 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 23:46:24 2018|12|To be fair he didn t say he didn t murder her 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 23:40:20 2018|88|When I did hair I d always err a bit longer because tbh most people don t want their hair as short as they say they do when all is said and done I imagine it s similar with being a tailor There would be a few people who legit wanted their hair as short as they thought they wanted it and like dozens who didn t It s a bummer for OP but I totally get where the tailor is coming from minus the insistence about heels 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 22:54:34 2018|45|You should take them back And have him take more off I ve had this happen a number of times Tailors are funny they tend to err on the longer side because it s always easier to take more off than to add length back 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 21:52:38 2018|25|I don t think anyone s arguing that they shouldn t have a choice The question is whether it actually is a choice or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 21:47:13 2018|40|Exactly It s really hard to definitively call it their choice I don t think they should be restricted from wearing them but is a choice that has been heavily influenced from birth really a choice or is it conditioning 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 21:14:43 2018|41|Not that I agree with them being banned but there s no real way to determine if a hijab is worn voluntarily or not A lot of it comes from pressure in societies that work to oppress women s free will 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 20:56:28 2018|28|Plus in the situation you re in it sounds like your personal safety would be at risk This probably isn t the hill you want to die on 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 18:20:07 2018|8|It would be impossible to know that though 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 15:39:08 2018|17|You ll be okay Give yourself some time to be sad and you ll feel better soon 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 15:02:16 2018|31|Well there you go They re not forcing you into full face so you don t really need to worry about breaking out since you don t have to wear foundation 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 14:03:54 2018|20|Do you have to wear a full face Why not just toss on some mascara and call it a day 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 13:43:30 2018|48|People s lives preferences and personalities are constantly evolving Stop focusing on an old friendship and try to make new ones You don t need to cut her off or anything but there isn t any reason to make a big thing out of a friendship changing form 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 13:40:42 2018|50|Right you can t help how you feel but you can control your actions Mentioning the beach trip isn t doing you any favors You can t honestly say you expect to be the only person she ever invites to something like that She s allowed to have other friends 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 13:25:33 2018|27|If it wasn t L that she went to the beach with would you feel a need to bring it up to her when seeing a pic 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 05:11:55 2018|20|If you think calling little boys future patriarchs is implying that they re evil then it s an accurate statement 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 04:13:10 2018|13|Oh okay So you don t undertand what a patriarch is Got it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 03:46:50 2018|31|How does it say that It says the rise of the feminist movement has also caused a rise in men who hate women It doesn t say anything about all men 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 26 00:39:01 2018|14|Probably regularly walking around in places with a lot of people like a city 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 23:33:04 2018|13|Respect his choice and either end things or wait until he s ready 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 18:06:39 2018|15|The mode of adhesive is the most relevant part of all this you re right 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 17:53:31 2018|77|Well no her entire original post revolved around the stickers and how she felt like she needed to say something or do something about them It was only an afterthought that she felt she could call the police on them for being on the side of the road She s edited her post and comments numerous times after being asked about that so it s no surprise if now it seems like she was concerned about safety 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 17:35:37 2018|23|She said lower down in the comments that she wouldn t have considered calling the police had it not been for the stickers 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:41:22 2018|22|That s because if you called the cops on someone for parking in a parking lot the police would laugh at you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:33:42 2018|53|It s was removed I guess And I know what you were responding to as I was the person that said it But your reasons for disagreeing with the stickers don t really have anything to do with whether or not they should be allowed to have them or display them with impunity 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:29:01 2018|51|It s not irrelevant You wouldn t have done anything if they weren t displaying an opinion you disliked If you re considering using the cops to penalize a person for disagreeing with you don t be surprised or outraged when someone does the same to you or someone you know 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:26:35 2018|55|She s allowed to not like someone s political views absolutely But there s not really any reason to call the cops on a person for expressing them Especially since she wouldn t have done anything about the truck if it didn t display views she disagreed with I don t remember who you are 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:21:58 2018|34|Did the people who voted for representatives that voted to shut down planned parenthood swayed by stickers on a truck Will keeping stickers on a truck from being seen in public change their minds 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:15:19 2018|19|The topic itself is exactly about stickers on a truck It doesn t matter what the stickers are about 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:14:36 2018|23|That doesn t answer my question actually Would you have gone online and asked people if you should call the police on them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:01:50 2018|37|So if they didn t have the stickers would you be posting online asking whether to call the police on them Since you re just worried about a truck on the shoulder of the road and all 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:00:41 2018|8|It s a bumper sticker on a truck 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 16:00:08 2018|46|No that s literally a difference of opinion Some people think abortion is murder and some people don t The former may be idiots but their opinion is still an opinion that they re free to express Just like I did when I called them idiots 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 15:44:31 2018|30|Because we live in a time where every difference of opinion no matter how it s stated needs to end in someone being arrested fined or put on blast online 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 15:39:07 2018|27|Sure call the city on them but don t put up a stink when someone calls the city of a car with bumper stickers supporting Planned Parenthood 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 06:00:24 2018|16|You think some random dude generalizing women on Reddit is going to brighten someone s day 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 05:53:06 2018|36|Oh wow a man who is supportive of women let s give him a big pat on the back for not being a garbage person Wow wow so amazing Is that what you re looking for 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 05:46:55 2018|16|I d say that s similar to taking out the trash if it s garbage day 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 01:15:32 2018|9|Why does someone else s weight trigger you snowflake 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 00:52:36 2018|9|You have an interesting way of showing you care 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 00:49:29 2018|40|You might want to see an eye specialist if you are unable to look away from something Unless your neck is the problem Then physical therapy might be good See what your PCP recommends because that s definitely a problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 00:43:58 2018|5|Have you tried not looking 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 00:09:52 2018|13|They re all you and they re all suspended so it s fine

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 25 00:00:28 2018|64|Do I sound upset Sorry if it comes across that way I m reclining in my chair doing absolutely nothing for the next hour so it really isn t much energy being expended I don t particularly care how you split your chores with your partner but you re basically saying OP isn t pulling his weight which is not the case at all 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 23:56:54 2018|12|You understand this is a public forum where people discuss things yea 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 23:51:38 2018|19|I m not offended I m simply saying that your viewpoint on what is equal or not is unrealistic 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 23:45:46 2018|62|You seem really petty Like I said in the other comment people pull their weight in different ways It is literally impossible to keep things 100 even down the board so one person takes some things and the other person takes others If you are the type of person that can t accept that I feel for you and your future relationships 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 23:39:18 2018|16|So just going to ignore the part about snow removal lawn care and home repairs or 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 23:33:24 2018|39|He s also doing 5 acres of lawn maintenance snow removal and home repairs If she s tidying up daily and it s just the two of them I doubt the time she spends doing chores seriously outweighs that 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 23:22:13 2018|25|What isn t equal about it Working all day 4 times a year is pretty equal to an hour or less of daily tiding chores 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 23:18:38 2018|25|It really depends on how you quantify things everyone pulls their weight in different ways and every couple gets to decide what ways those are 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 23:00:08 2018|76|I dunno for us I don t think the house is going to fall into a horrific state of disarray just because it doesn t get tidied up for a day Like if it s garbage day and I m terribly ill sure he will bring the garbage out but other than that it s not really his job to do the tidying up dishes vacuuming etc and I wouldn t ask him to do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 22:42:15 2018|53|I have a similar arrangement as OP and usually the chores just wait for me to get better Though it s rare that I am ever bedridden and if I am it s just for the day My adulting doesn t stop just because I m sick Neither of us have that luxury 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 22:39:33 2018|1|Wary
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 21:39:33 2018|25|If it s a problem for her then yes it is a problem If not she should tell her friends to mind their own business 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 20:57:53 2018|37|But you said in your last comment that you still don t understand what it means I m asking what you don t understand so I can explain it to you Since English is your third language 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 20:52:30 2018|9|What don t you understand The phrase about feminism 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 20:43:26 2018|44|So saying I don t talk to those people about feminism was confusing the first time but you understood it when I said the exact same thing again I think you were just looking to argue about something and started talking out your ass 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 20:24:16 2018|49|To a degree but it s such a small sample size Plus it doesn t tell us much conclusively unless all the babies involved suffered the exact same ailment to the exact same severity pre study and were started on the medication at the exact same point in gestation 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 20:20:49 2018|15|You must have misread what I wrote I don t talk to people about feminism 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 18:53:32 2018|32|That is interesting The babies had a poor prognosis to begin with so I am interested to see how they will be able to conclude whether the drug is what caused it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 17:44:23 2018|20|Almost never I rarely know specifically where I want to eat and he likes just about every kind of cuisine 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 17:42:21 2018|16|Sounds like a complete asshole misogynist but I don t think incel is the right descriptor 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 16:23:51 2018|21|I just don t talk to those people about feminism and I change the subject if it happens to come up 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 15:16:06 2018|12|Welcome but I doubt you ll find Reddit to be much better 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 24 00:14:11 2018|5|This isn t relevant here 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 22:55:04 2018|29|Why do you think your opinion on other s life choices is at all relevant to the point that you think you should be sharing it like it matters 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 20:29:46 2018|21|Honestly pretty messed up if you are accusing him of sexual assault after being a willing and enthusiastic participant in it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 20:22:13 2018|23|So two were getting intimate and progressed toward sex and you willingly participated and enjoyed what was going on so he assumed consent 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 18:33:22 2018|34|It really doesn t matter if you buy it or not All babies are different and if you re too dense to realize that it s your issue not the woman or the baby 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 18:20:14 2018|2|Wrong username 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 18:07:27 2018|16|So wait Babies need to suffer because fully function adult human beings have no self control 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 17:30:29 2018|19|It s not comfortable for many babies to have a coverup over them while they re trying to eat 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 17:29:40 2018|78|So that goes back to what I said about media sensationalism It s the hot topic to make a big deal about Add confirmation bias to that and it seems like a bigger and more common problem than it actually is However it s wrong in any degree absolutely It s just not really top on my list of problems to tackle beyond responding to any discrimination I would see in public which is none at this point 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 17:20:34 2018|14|I thought you said you aren t a mom How are you experiencing shaming 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 17:08:06 2018|42|I think both men and women are responsible for public shaming of breastfeeding I also think the media sensationalizes things and the amount of explicit public shaming is not as common as one would think But even a little bit is wrong 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 16:44:06 2018|14|You need to go to a doctor considering you had a positive pregnancy test 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 15:21:06 2018|16|Probably because they ve only been together a short time and vacations are planned in advance 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 14:57:37 2018|45|He s on vacation though He s got other things to do It s pretty silly to think he s going to have the same communication style when he s on vacation Let him enjoy himself and see how things are when he gets back 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 14:01:02 2018|39|It depends on the woman Just like some people are happy with like a million cats or dogs while others prefer just one I have a handful of friends with lots of kids and none of them are religious 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 05:01:38 2018|38|I am pretty sure that doesn t fit the definition of stalking If you re planning on buying her a handgun because of this I d say you re pretty reactionary and need to chill out a bit 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 01:46:48 2018|24|No one person isn t representative of an entire gender culture ethnicity whatever I d be embarrassed for myself if I actually thought that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 23:56:44 2018|18|Why Read them if you want and move on if they re too long for your attention span 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 21:14:41 2018|94|Discussing it is one thing If you read the thread we are in the OC suggested complaining to the manager My response was to the person who told her how laughable that idea is in Italy That s like if when I was in Morocco a few weeks ago I complained to the restaurant owner because I was uncomfortable having to wear long sleeves and a long skirt in a hot restaurant It s a completely clueless thing to do and shows complete lack of understanding that any societal norms beyond the US exist 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 20:59:41 2018|22|You had no problems with any street food vendors after that because you made a display in front of one of them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 20:55:38 2018|77|I mean the discussion is about that culture not US culture It s not arrogant to expect that people would consider the culture they re discussing before imposing US standards onto it If I go to Korea with my family I pour everyone s drinks I don t say Fuck y all I m American and refuse to do it The real arrogance is going to another country and expecting them to conform to your own standards 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 20:52:09 2018|37|It s Italian women s choice whether they want a change in their culture or not It s not American women s job to go to other countries and insist that they conform to our societal standards 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 20:50:24 2018|4|Good luck with that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 19:46:35 2018|14|You ve heard about their work culture but not their attitude toward women apparently 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 19:45:37 2018|5|Just ignorance to other cultures 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 19:24:36 2018|29|That sounds like a normal amount of time to dedicate to a hobby If he liked building model airplanes or working on his car would you feel the same 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 19:13:34 2018|18|Yea lol OP is going to change the entire Italian culture by asking to speak to the manager 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 19:11:57 2018|12|Right It s funny how US centric this sub is sometimes always 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 18:57:50 2018|27|When people are hysterical there isn t really anything to do to calm them down Sometimes it s best to let it blow over before addressing things 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 15:44:22 2018|8|Have you asked him to stop Like directly 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 15:13:22 2018|26|Its irrelevant since it s all rape Edit sexual assault The amount of pain you felt during it doesn t make it more or less rapey 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 14:27:38 2018|16|How many people did you invite What about his friends from school Can you call them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 14:25:49 2018|41|He s a medical professional Chances at he didn t feel it was an urgent thing It s probably something he has seen a lot and he knew it wasn t at the point where he needed to act on it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 14:19:30 2018|2|Literally everyone 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 05:21:23 2018|14|No one can tell you how you will be affected by specific birth control 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 02:54:45 2018|33|I think the trailer made it clear it was a bit more heavy but not everyone watches the trailer He didn t and it wasn t what he was in the mood for 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 02:10:28 2018|18|I had watched the trailer for it and he hadn t so that might have played into it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 02:09:36 2018|15|He was expecting a comedy special I don t think it s absurd at all 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 01:15:25 2018|52|Sure though he s had to deal with his own fair share of stuff It s not really the specific subject matter he didn t like He just isn t the kind of person that likes serious comedy I dunno what else to call it I think he was expecting more laughs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 22 00:51:05 2018|29|Yes I am Because I believe in equality I don t have an opinion on why third wave feminism is criticized because I don t care that it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 21 23:49:38 2018|10|I liked it husband thought it was too heavy handed 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 21 21:42:44 2018|13|Yea thank you and that s part of it are definitely conversation inhibitors 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 21 20:33:31 2018|40|I agree that it won t do much to put a dent in the amount of illegal sex trafficking but that s not really a reason not to decriminalize it Even a minor dent I better than nothing at all 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 21 20:08:56 2018|10|No there s no proven way to delay your period 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 21 19:59:27 2018|23|Birth control isn t going to regulate her period in a week and she can have breakthrough bleeding from the change in hormones 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 21 19:59:04 2018|12|Birth control isn t going to regulate your period in a week 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 23:24:17 2018|47|They should probably use disability access as a point of argument rather than something as arbitrary as high heels that is absolutely a good reason to design things differently not the personal choice to wear shoes that are unsafe even on a completely flat and grippy surface 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 23:21:31 2018|22|You can take off your shoe walk on a glass floor or staircase too like I said in my very first comment 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 23:10:38 2018|55|Like I said in my first comment I agree about the skirt thing not the shoes Skirts are just normal wear that don t create day to day challengers otherwise High heels are physical problematic on completely neutral floor so they shouldn t be taken into account when thinking of practicality They re already impractical 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 23:04:34 2018|45|So if you get your heel caught in one of those and get injured you can file a lawsuit too That doesn t mean the city is going to or needs to redesign things to take into account the personal choice of wearing dangerous shoes 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 22:54:16 2018|66|Unless high heels are some kind of dress code requirement in which case that should change the more practical option would be to not wear high heels Some people wear long skirts or robes that can easily get caught in an escalator but it s pretty silly to call for the removal of escalators because of it Actually heels work as a good example here too 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 22:50:11 2018|14|There are grated and stairs all over pretty much any city glass or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 22:07:17 2018|13|Just adding onto the list of things in modern times getting glass floors 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 21:59:31 2018|107|The high heels thing is kinda silly They re notoriously more difficult to walk in and are totally a personal choice We don t need to design buildings to keep high heels in mind Skirts I feel fall into a similar vein BUT you can take off high heels if worse comes to worse A skirt is a day long choice and you generally can t foresee entering a place with glass floors or ceilings that far in advance If it s in a building that s meant for function and daily use it s probably not a great idea regardless of how cool looking it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 21:54:43 2018|7|The Space Needle just got glass floors 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 21:16:28 2018|10|Didn t read the body Answer to question is yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 21:15:43 2018|17|No one should be shamed for formula feeding adopted baby or not What a bunch of assholes 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 19:41:09 2018|25|It is interesting that you all resort to name calling and or insulting me as a person but I m the one who is childish 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 19:32:13 2018|14|If you are having a mental breakdown you need to seek professional help immediately 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 19:25:33 2018|39|I mean you re commenting on something from yesterday and my responses are everywhere I don t feel like repeating myself to you because you decided to come by today and parrot the same thing some other people said 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 19:19:28 2018|1|Cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 17:38:07 2018|68|Agreed Even if the bartender was just trying to give her shit in a grizzled bartender sort of way he needs to know how to read the room and act appropriately When it was apparent she wasn t comfortable with his joking he should have stopped The guy shouldn t get fired or anything but I think a reminder that he is essentially in customer service is important 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 17:21:49 2018|128| Not everyone or everything is out to get you Not sure where I said they were And sending someone a drink doesn t mean they are socially stunted Yes it does It s an opening If you don t like it great Send back the drink and don t talk to the person right That s the point You seem to be very judgmental about something that in most cases is an opening to flirting You aren t obligated to accept or respond Again that is totally correct But they aren t innately creepy or socially stunted because they tried to flirt That s where we disagree Ha You really know everything don t you I reckon in know myself my preferences and what I find attractive yea 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 17:18:13 2018|13|That would be something like attempted assault so I wouldn t advise that 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 17:08:48 2018|139| Why Because someone was making an effort to introduce themselves to you How exactly is someone sending an unsolicited drink to a complete stranger they ve never spoken to is Introducing themselves to someone That s not an introduction in any way shape or form Unless the intended introduction is Hi I m completely socially stunted and incapable of speaking And I m presumptuous enough to think I know what you like to drink just by looking at you Is it that sending a stranger a drink is innately creepy Yes Or would it depend on how attracted you were to the drink sender That is a non issue because I wouldn t be attracted to someone who did that And if sending a drink is creepy what is an appropriate opener I dunno maybe using words Crazy thought 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 16:55:42 2018|14|Verifying full name and DOB two identifiers is what we do in the US 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 16:49:49 2018|9|Depends on the person but I find it creepy 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 16:45:22 2018|26|I guess Like I said specifically saying you look 14 is weird but something like never would have guessed that seems like a pretty normal interaction 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 16:44:08 2018|9|It s required to verify the date of birth 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 16:43:21 2018|17|Honestly anyone who sends drinks to two random women who literally just sat down is pretty creepy 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 16:38:52 2018|26|I think verifying your age is normal and a passing comment about you looking younger is fine but saying specifically that you look 14 is weird 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 15:28:21 2018|30|I figured it was clear I was talking about a kid that I can have a discussion with I didn t know it required me to explicitly state that qualifier 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 20 15:21:49 2018|31|A toddler s only reason for saying no to anything is generally because I don t wanna so as a parent it s my responsibility to have them do it anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 23:19:38 2018|9|You re quite riled up Everything okay at home 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 23:19:06 2018|25|You should probably calm down if someone on the Internet choosing to raise their kid differently than what you prefer is this upsetting to you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 21:58:13 2018|7|I m sorry but that is insane 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 21:57:51 2018|18|Children develop at different rates and some are capable of hashing out their reasoning abilities earlier than others 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 21:42:23 2018|34|Uh are you really drawing comparisons between having a conversation with my kid about why they don t want to hug a person and being actively involved advocating in sexually assaulting a child or 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 21:23:54 2018|96| Yeah and I feel you don t I feel I don t care If you were a boss and forced an employee to hug a client and the employee was completely not okay with that would you also need to have a discussion or should you rightfully be in legal problems for even making that suggestion in a position of power I imagine all people involved in this scenario are adults who are capable of making informed decisions for themselves and aren t relying on their employer to help them develop into functioning grown human beings 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 21:18:59 2018|11|It all ties together Do whatever you want with your kiddos 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 21:18:20 2018|6|Looks like I just did cupcake 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 21:17:53 2018|18|As I said I feel we need to have a discussion and see why they feel that way 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 21:12:59 2018|10|That would just depend on the child and their development 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 20:51:05 2018|9|Disagree It s not black and white like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 20:41:23 2018|17|Kids aren t stupid They are capable of understanding the concept of good touch vs bad touch 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 19:31:55 2018|39|Of course society changes but the changes aren t always for the better I m pretty progressive but I don t think I ll ever agree to letting a kid call the shots without any pushback from their parents 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 19:29:13 2018|25|What s right in this case isn t objective by any means but your aggressive and condescending attitude isn t doing your side any favors 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 19:09:27 2018|25|I hear what people are saying I just don t agree with it People can choose what they think is best for their own kids 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 19:04:26 2018|17|Why are you getting so angry at me sharing what I ll be doing with my kid 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 18:41:36 2018|22|You should mind your own business You re not involved in this at all but you re trying to shoehorn yourself in 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 18:11:30 2018|30|Understanding normal human interaction and adapting to societal norms is absolutely as important as physical health You do whatever you want with your kid It s your kid not mine 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 18:01:36 2018|106|Sure it s okay but he should still be encouraged to do it I don t think condoning defiance toward trusted adults is the right way to teach kids about consent or proper touching Just like if my kid doesn t want to eat any vegetables I m going to encourage him to do so It s his body but Im still going to tell him what to do with it If a kid is averse to very normal human interactions like hugging a family member not making any effort to have him adapt to societal norms isn t going to do anything positive for him 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 16:47:35 2018|37|On a similar note what happened to the whole teaching of good touching and bad touching I don t see how having a child hug their grandpa is teaching them that all touching has to be okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 16:04:13 2018|25|The point you were trying to make was obscured by snarkiness She s sharing her experience about the topic at hand and you responded condescendingly 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 15:52:25 2018|10|It s almost as if all children are different people 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 15:41:55 2018|7|So that would be needing an abortion 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 15:26:02 2018|75|I wouldn t go that far this particular subject is a bit of a gray area but at the same time I do find the whole idea of never forcing your kid to do anything bad news bears Kids need a push sometimes They need guidance Their thoughts and feelings should be taken into account but I think it s pretty silly to think they can make their own decisions about a lot of things 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 15:01:27 2018|14|I d probably explore with them why they don t want to do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 13:55:38 2018|28|That s not a fair assessment Men have plenty of societal pressures to adhere to Everyone does It shouldn t be an us vs them mentality like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 13:53:10 2018|37|I ll encourage my kid to hug family members and friends but I won t encourage them to kiss them I don t really like the idea of any adult besides a parent kissing a kid tbh 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 05:28:46 2018|11|It s ironic because they re the biggest troll of all 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 00:37:53 2018|40|Whether the spelling is actually as important is irrelevant because people who are going to argue against the existence of privilege are going to use the fact that no one can spell it as a reason to dismiss the idea 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 00:35:43 2018|48|Senator Franken forcibly kissed and groped numerous women You shouldn t be bringing him up as a comparison for what is and isn t okay to do You are defending him and that s fuckin gross and hypocritical Please show me where I condoned what Rep Lewis said 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 00:30:02 2018|53|That s an odd conclusion to jump to I m just saying if it s so important to use the word privilege when describing someone s advantages in a patriarchal society being able to get that point across without misspelling the word is kinda important I didn t say anything about their experience 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 00:19:16 2018|9| So how is that worse than sexually assaulting someone 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 00:15:59 2018|19|I don t know why everyone in this thread is having such a hard time spelling the word privilege 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 00:14:42 2018|7|I think you mean obtuse not opaque 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 19 00:09:58 2018|8|How is what Al Franken did much less 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 14:15:06 2018|59|I would have laughed at a comment like that I don t honestly see the big deal But if it bothered you and you are unhappy in the relationship I m not sure why you are staying with him You don t need a bunch of advice from random people online You need to trust yourself and your decisions 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 14:12:15 2018|13|I would have laughed at a comment like that I don t Henso
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 14:09:48 2018|11|I m not a WhatAboutTheMen type bit what about gay men 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 14:04:45 2018|12|Probably just some incels trying to get statistics to use against women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 06:08:29 2018|23|She was telling the story as if it was in the present tense Like so you can go on the journey with her 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 04:35:28 2018|33|A bikini with a higher waist or a one piece with actual straps would work better Without the straps it seems like you re constantly slouching to keep your boobs from popping out 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 00:34:50 2018|9|You gained weight so you clothing size went up 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 00:09:17 2018|29|I might be wrong but I don t think OP posted this as a who s right in this situation sort of thing More of just a funny anecdote 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 18 00:05:57 2018|4|It s a troll 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 23:52:29 2018|15|English Perhaps not a term everywhere but it basically means like thumbs up but more 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 23:46:41 2018|35|I personally wouldn t have thought to share it but I don t think there s anything wrong with her sharing it It gave a lot of us a good chuckle so that s cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 23:18:14 2018|16|Nah it s cute and light hearted which is exactly what this sub needs more of 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 23:17:05 2018|7|So you didn t read it then 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 21:44:53 2018|8|I love this You saluted him So good 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 20:40:49 2018|19|A non sterile cup isn t going to randomly test positive for STIs STI testing is dirty catch anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 18:22:50 2018|29|Ya my parents provided me with both girl and boy clothes toys and here I am in my 30s just wandering around with no structured thoughts of my own 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 17:22:28 2018|32|I m sure your kiddo will be a okay So as you don t give her a hard time if she ultimately decides she wants to play with wear less feminine stuff 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 17:18:18 2018|5|Or more interesting assertive approachable 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 17:12:56 2018|12|You asked a question so I answered it That is a discussion 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 17:10:21 2018|9|Because people can raise their kids how they prefer 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 17:08:01 2018|102|Kids get influenced from birth so while the kid will probably end up doing their own thing and will also have societal influence I don t want them to feel like I have a preference about what they do either way Giving them gender specific stuff would just show them that I want them to conform rather than make their own decisions When they re old enough to say you don t have to buy me any more trucks or dinos I prefer Barbie then I ll do that but I don t want to lead them either way in the meantime 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 16:15:23 2018|70|I don t really care what other people do but I won t be getting my kid anything gender specific until he she gets old enough to decide they want it In the end kids are going to like what they re going to like If a kid wants to wear a dress he s going to want to wear a dress regardless of how hard you push the opposite 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 14:07:26 2018|72|I don t think that believing in gender roles is necessarily internalized misogyny I think people can believe what they want as far as that goes and even believe other people should adhere to the same standards so long as they don t look down upon it treat different the people who choose not to Then it becomes internalized sexism not misogyny because it affects men just as poorly in many ways 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 14:00:40 2018|39|Traveling to other countries and seeing how different people live should be helping you grow as a person Unless you re staying in resorts every time it is really enriching your life experience whether you realize it or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 17 04:10:38 2018|17|I took his name because I wanted to have the same last name as my future kid 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 23:27:08 2018|66|I think you re taking this much much more seriously than I am or than is necessary OP is going to survive My comment that she should have spoken to the business before posting her review isn t going to ruin her life or her day It seems to have ruined yours though unless you re just always like this Take a breath it s Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 23:23:21 2018|9|That s a funny thing to be infuriated about 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 22:48:37 2018|37|I do have good news though If OP lives in Seattle which her username may imply we can have an actual conversation about this Though I think that d be a bit silly over something so trivial 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 22:20:54 2018|25|So you re mad when I say she shouldn t have complained online but you re also mad when i say she should have Ok 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 21:20:20 2018|9|That s a pretty intense reaction Are you okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 21:18:56 2018|64|I don t know if you re familiar with Reddit but it is anonymous I don t really have the choice to discuss in person with OP the way I feel she should have handled the situation I suppose if she wants to she can PM me her info and if we re close enough we can get a coffee and talk about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 21:17:08 2018|12|I m simply responding to people who have responded to my comments 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 21:15:44 2018|42|Lol I m not a victim The amount of outrage over some fairly mundane comments has kept me entertained for a bit so really I m the opposite of a victim Reddit can be boring sometimes and this has been less boring 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 21:13:49 2018|21|You know it s possible for her to talk to them and also leave a review about her experience afterwards yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 18:46:07 2018|26|Isn t the point of calling someone a name to insult them How can I be insulted when I don t even know what it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 18:41:02 2018|16|It doesn t hold much weight when you can t explain what it is you farfenfluken 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 18:39:09 2018|8|Why Don t you know what it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 18:37:00 2018|5|What s a keyboard warrior 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 18:26:18 2018|2|Because Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 17:38:31 2018|16|I mean that s pretty silly You can t just assume things exist without any proof 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 16:45:26 2018|54|Yea after letting the business know she was dissatisfied with the service and giving them a chance to help I sometimes forget I m on Reddit when I respond to these things Passive aggression and not directly addressing a situation is kind of the status quo so it s my mistake for suggesting otherwise 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 16:19:31 2018|23|Why does what fucking matter If she has seen a pattern of them bullying lower star reviews she should definitely make it public 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 16:17:34 2018|42|If she contacted them they could give her tips on how to style it air dried in the meantime provide a refund and perhaps give her complimentary products to help her out There could have been a lot to diffuse the situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 16:13:00 2018|32|In a situation where a problem can be helped or fixed there is no reason not to ask the business to do that I didn t know that was a controversial idea 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 16:08:53 2018|40|I m just wondering as she seems very confident that this stuff is going on If there are other accounts of them bullying people to take down their reviews she can contact a local news outlet and make it public 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 16:03:08 2018|5|So none then Got it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 16:01:38 2018|12|Did you miss my other comment Keep the name calling to yourself 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 16:00:55 2018|69|She has no idea how they would have responded She assumes they d be rude because they got defensive after she put them on blast without even trying to let them fix the situation first I m not trying to suggest anything Im straight up saying it s bad form to not give a salon a chance to diffuse a situation before going on line to air your grievances 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 15:57:21 2018|32|You totally disagree that you should allow a company to remedy a situation before putting them on blast online Okay I m starting to think the salon isn t the problem here 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 15:53:32 2018|18|So what other accounts have you heard of someone being harassed when they ve given a poor review 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 15:51:53 2018|26|Hair grows about 1 2 inch per month If yours grows a bit slower than that taking women s vitamins will sometimes help it grow faster 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 15:49:37 2018|58|It s always good to let them know first that you were unsatisfied with your service They may not be able to fix it but it s likely you d be refunded Immediately putting them on blast online without giving them any chance to remedy the situation is unfair Not that the owner should have been rude though 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 15:29:42 2018|16|Did you call the salon and tell them about being unsatisfied before posting a review online 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 13:46:48 2018|23|You ll be okay I ve had numerous polyps removed it is uncomfortable but nothing major Rest up afterwards and feel bettter soon 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 13:44:13 2018|39| There is no accidents happen in medicineThat s the most ridiculous statement I ve ever heard If you think any human is incapable of having an accident I have trouble taking anything else you ve said at face value 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 13:36:18 2018|58|Accidents happen It sucks but every involved is human and no one is infallible regardless of how much money they re paid The statistic you quoted seemed to imply that it is a common occurrence which it isn t Especially in OP s case as I doubt she will even have an incision let alone be opened up 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 13:32:20 2018|46|I wouldn t worry about tools being left inside It s not all that common and I m going to venture a guess to say they re going up through your vagina cervix to your uterus It s pretty impossible to leave a tool up there 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 16 13:29:39 2018|15|800 in over a decade is pretty low considering how many surgeries have been performed 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 23:42:43 2018|5|Yea good luck with that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 23:37:13 2018|1|No 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 23:36:06 2018|11|And sometimes shorter which is why the average is 9 months 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 23:32:32 2018|10|They re probably getting removed or he s shadow banned 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 23:31:53 2018|11|Why do you want a liberal girlfriend You have conservative beliefs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 23:21:59 2018|23|Only date pro life women then Your opinion on wanting a kid is irrelevant to her opinion of what happens to her body 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 23:00:40 2018|6|Put a warm compress on it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 22:55:46 2018|4|Is it a pimple 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 14:38:46 2018|77|You seem pretty intense Are you like this all the time Sometimes it s not about gender but intense personality That s a lesson I learned when I was younger I was able to pull the reigns a bit and learn how to get my opinion across in a serious manner without flying off the handle Sometimes it s harder for women and it can get frustrating but staying cool makes it easier to be taken seriously 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 04:48:20 2018|17|I know it s not about body hair I m responding to the parent commenter not OP 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 04:22:27 2018|31|We can also report people for ban evading Don t you get tired of thinking of new usernames instead of just not participating in a place where you aren t welcome 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 04:07:17 2018|19|Fathers shouldn t be concerned with their daughters body hair and if they are it s creepy as fuck 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 03:43:14 2018|43|But medical misogyny isn t limited to male doctors And frankly with autoimmune disorders I think everyone tends to have a hard time regardless of gender The fact that women disproportionately suffer from autoimmune disorders would skew things as far as that goes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 03:05:04 2018|30|She is definitely sharing her own personal experience But her specification about the doctors being male seems to imply that they were only invalidating her experience because of their gender 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 02:21:14 2018|51|Oh now you re trying to argue about it but on my other comment you said I was right The gender of your doctors isn t relevant to the care you received The fact that you emphasized that they were male just takes away from any valid point you were making 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 02:05:32 2018|14| pretty much everyone here jumped on her for saying it was only male docs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 00:33:27 2018|23|I like to pretend all those people are still just spoofing something and don t actually believe the crap they post but alas 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul 15 00:28:51 2018|7|Yea definitely just a liberal thing s
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 21:57:09 2018|0| 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 21:54:33 2018|8|Bobby Newport has never had a real job 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 21:52:40 2018|16|I want to know what Reddit you are on that is pro women and anti slutshaming 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 21:11:00 2018|27|I m not arguing that it s appropriate but the dude doesn t need to be reprimanded He was just trying to help the poor girl out 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 21:08:42 2018|64|He s a soccer dad with first aid training and a girl in a severe amount of pain is seeking help from him He s likely not a medical professional and was just doing what he could to help her out No it wasn t great but I think he was just doing what he could do to help in a high tension situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 21:05:36 2018|43|Honestly stinging nettles are extremely painful and I assume she was probably showing her pain pretty profoundly He probably didn t think twice and just wanted to help her No it wasn t appropriate but I don t think his intentions were nefarious 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 18:32:47 2018|47|Eh my male doctor took my concerns seriously right away and gave me a dx after numerous female doctors poopoo d it away Women not being taken seriously at the doctor is a big problem but female medical personnel are pretty much just as guilty of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 18:29:30 2018|3|No bad idea 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 18:04:26 2018|10|You said to cut out fructose not eat less fructose 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 16:25:18 2018|11|You said to cut out fructose and or increase dietary fiber 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 15:53:48 2018|17|Is it your inability to use Reddit that make syou come off as a horrible controlling boyfriend 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 15:49:10 2018|18|I don t think telling a fat person not to eat fruits or veggies is a good idea 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 15:45:42 2018|1|Hahhahahahahaha
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 00:45:39 2018|82|I have a friend who has had two kiddos and her abdominal muscles got damaged with the second one so she still looks pregnant It s rough because people regularly ask her if she s expecting but she s developed a sense of humor about it and just says nope I m just fat It might be difficult to crack jokes about it but it s also a good light hearted way to hint to people that they shouldn t assume things 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 00:27:22 2018|20|It sounds like he likes the lace tank top and you re putting a lot more weight into his words 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 14 00:07:15 2018|3|Cool story bro 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 22:39:08 2018|16|You posted about wedgies earlier on here too Is this some kind of fetish for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 22:36:35 2018|12|I didn t know people used the term popular after high school 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 19:55:01 2018|67|I think that removes the gravity from the word A man throwing his video game controller is not akin to people who murder and dismember prostitutes or torture animals which is how it is usually used It s a man throwing a video game controller It s irrational and stupid yea And he shouldn t be invalidating the fact that it makes OP uncomfortable but deranged Nah 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 19:02:43 2018|14|We are playing a little fast and loose with the word deranged dontcha think 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 18:21:59 2018|67|Eh maybe Or maybe not I ve been with my husband who is in his 40s for 8 years and he does tantrumy shit like throwing his video game controller occasionally He s never hit a person or animal in his life and he never will It can be a warning sign but it s one of those things that isn t necessarily something that will progress 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 18:10:41 2018|5|She should seek professional help 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 16:09:31 2018|44|Uh dude All you did was say Hello and get on an elevator If someone is so fragile that they get very uncomfortable about it those are their feelings they need to work through It s not on you to alter completely normal behavior 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 16:03:52 2018|15|Saying Hello and riding an elevator like a normal human being isn t a mistake 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 15:00:41 2018|12|Did the article or myself say it was okay the other way 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 13 06:06:24 2018|8|So does that mean that it s okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 22:36:46 2018|10|Food in your vagina would generally cause some issues yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 22:15:47 2018|5| Your feelings don t matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 22:11:05 2018|25|Why do you think you as a man have a right to tell a woman her feelings about a women s issue don t matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 22:02:35 2018|6|You sound mighty defensive over this 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 22:02:00 2018|5|Aren t you a guy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 21:09:44 2018|35|The harassment of female broadcasters is a big problem so I think it s weird that there seems to be more focus in this article on whether or not to show attractive women on TV 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 16:15:35 2018|65|It really doesn t matter if you agree with me or not I can say as a woman that I m not comfortable having the language be gender neutral in that situation and other women agree with me So it doesn t please 100 of the people and your original point is moot I don t really care what makes logical sense to you sorry 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 14:53:04 2018|12|If you read my first comment it gives a reason right there 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 13:45:08 2018|18|Don t have sex until you re better or you ll just infect your partner and get reinfected 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 13:21:54 2018|31|Because gender neutral language in this situation doesn t work for 100 of the people I reckon if you take a poll it works for fewer people than gender specific language 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 03:38:02 2018|41|Then tell him that But also examine why you felt it was necessary to do something like that in the first place He s your husband Why did you want to remove any of the surprise and playfulness in your relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 03:35:11 2018|11|I d say yes and then have him return the ring 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 03:32:37 2018|21|gender fluid people and trans men do too but I don t think it s common enough to change the language 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 01:43:24 2018|8|Oh wow that didn t take very long 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 01:33:12 2018|12|Then it s especially pathetic that you know so little about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 01:04:49 2018|72|I don t think we do I think because the OVERWHELMING majority of people who get abortions identify as women we can keep the language the way it is If someone wants a different pronoun they can tell the providers their preferences and it should be honored but to make it gender neutral I feel takes away the gravity that this is something that specifically affects one sex disproportionately over the other 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 22:25:00 2018|24|He probably froze because he needed to decide whether or not it was worth pissing you off by telling you how he really felt 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 19:47:27 2018|16|You have to really reflect on yourself because you re the only one who actually knows 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 19:45:34 2018|15|Basically everyone told you how ridiculous you are and it was reported for being disrespectful 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 05:55:48 2018|1|Uh 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul 11 00:34:45 2018|4|She specified her location 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 23:31:15 2018|18|Or lack of oxygen during childbirth plus autism usually isn t diagnosed until a few years after birth 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 23:24:10 2018|30|I interpreted that as her saying that OP wouldn t be able to abort a child with certain special needs because she wouldn t know about them until after birth 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 21:30:51 2018|10|They make dairy free versions of everything you just listed 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 20:09:43 2018|11|It s his cousin s wedding It s not about you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 20:07:43 2018|78|I didn t like the song when someone posted it a while ago because it all ends up boiling down to and then maybe she might fuck you when she s sober implication It s not y all take this girl home because she is vulnerable and needs to be safe it s take this girl home because when she sobers up she will see what a hero you are and you can go into the Bone Zone 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 18:47:57 2018|43|I mean you say he has gone through this stuff for himself as well If he has mental problems and then also has to bear the burden of your mental problems I find it pretty normal that he s shutting down about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 14:08:10 2018|72|Ash probably doesn t have the money to spend I wouldn t assume otherwise Jade likely wants her partner to be involved in the things she likes so is willing to pay for stuff in order for that to happen Make a little list next time and have couples sign up to bring stuff like soda or whatever Jade may still end up buying it but maybe it ll bother you less 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 05:53:59 2018|13|Whether or not he is pro choice is what the discussion is about 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 05:47:43 2018|10|The post is about him being pro choice or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 05:14:34 2018|25|Whether or not he s pro choice isn t irrelevant in a discussion that is literally about whether or not he is pro choice honey 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 04:45:54 2018|6|That doesn t answer my question 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 03:54:51 2018|10|What does that have to do with being pro Choice 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 03:40:37 2018|4|Is this a surprise 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 00:19:04 2018|34|I wouldn t say the pull out method is not at all effective in preventing pregnancy It s pretty good when done right it s failure rate is just higher than actual birth control 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul  9 21:54:36 2018|17| I have no experience or knowledge about this thing but let me tell you about it anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul  9 16:35:16 2018|16|Liking human interaction feeling happy for others does not compute danger danger half of Reddit explodes 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul  9 14:08:26 2018|28|You are saying that like it s some kind of universally accepted standard rather than just your personal opinion that reflects your specific bias against engagement ring pics 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul  9 13:59:45 2018|29|I think it s fine That s what someone s personal page is for to post milestones and stuff they like I reckon most people like their engagement rings 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul  9 13:57:31 2018|30|I take close up pictures of my dog or a pic of a particularly nice outfit for social media all the time Not sure why a ring is any different 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 21:07:31 2018|7|At 20 no most likely not covered 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 20:14:01 2018|40|I m wondering what comments you read as I said I did read the article And my comments pretty clearly say I kind of agree with the decision but not why they made it Also I m not a mom 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 18:58:11 2018|29|Babies also die because their moms can t produce enough breast milk and they don t have access to formula It s an issue with a lot of nuance 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 18:49:06 2018|52|I see it at work a few times a year The court has to consult with docs about the safety of formula feeding when kiddo stays overnight with dad Mom uses it as a reason why kiddo can t have overnight stays with dad docs say it s fine Rinse and repeat 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 18:44:23 2018|33|My insecurities about what I don t have any kids I work with moms and babies and have seen the very real effects of mom shaming so I am empathizing with those women 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 18:30:01 2018|16|Does it not contribute to the conversation Seems to have provided quite a bit of discussion 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 18:25:47 2018|8|Mom shaming just needs to stop either way 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 18:08:37 2018|23|I m talking about parents who are separated One of the arguments to keep the baby with the mom is because of feeding 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 18:06:45 2018|22|Nope Their babies will be getting formula either way so making them feel bad about it is just adding to their pain 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 17:11:58 2018|63|You re only including people that 100 can t breastfeed at all You re not including the women who need it to supplement their babies diets because they don t produce enough milk or babies that share time between parents The formula is evil is an argument a lot of moms use to deprive fathers of time with their children after birth too 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 16:38:33 2018|28|Because Reddit is full of trigger finger downvoters who don t want to get into a discussion but just want to show they disagree with what someone says 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 15:29:43 2018|28|I did read the article I m not saying the US s reasoning is the same as mine but I was explaining why I agreed with their decision 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 15:15:11 2018|12|Oh I d lose interest nearly immediately if someone never teased me 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 15:09:26 2018|99|Honestly I am not a fan of the US but in this case I kind of agree There are tons of moms that can t breast feed and feel shame for formula feeding their baby and I think an international initiative to stress even more how they re failing as moms will just hurt them Unless this also helps donor breast milk be easily available for anyone who needs it I don t think we need to turn up the heat on formula feeding moms even if the core goal is to turn up the heat on formula companies 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 14:03:14 2018|39|Your boyfriend is being stupid and shitty Your response were just fine and his idea that you need to validate your responses to some random dude by mentioning him is weird and controlling Tell him to get over himself 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 13:59:18 2018|10|You asked this already and the resounding answer was no 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 13:51:12 2018|12|Yes that s literally what the comment she is responding to says 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 04:28:16 2018|20|Lots of women don t like receiving oral sex That doesn t necessarily mean they hate themselves or their bodies 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 04:04:14 2018|22| when it stops working There are women it does work on which is why the idea that it works is so pervasive 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 03:21:40 2018|19|What a loser Good on you When it s safe to do so idiots should always be called out 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 03:12:37 2018|38|A lot of Koreans especially in a big city like Seoul understand English They re trying to get international attention so it would make sense to write things in a language that is more common internationally than Korean 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  8 03:10:37 2018|6|They re talking about the signs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul  7 16:21:17 2018|14|Why did you post if you re just going to argue with the responses 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul  7 14:51:30 2018|2|Move on 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul  7 14:19:45 2018|4|If what is sexy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul  7 14:17:39 2018|51|Your friend is being manipulative and trying to make you feel bad for being an attractive person If it bothers her so much she needs to work on herself and stop going out for a while It s unfair for her to lowkey guilt trip you because you attract more men 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul  7 04:51:18 2018|25|If Reddit bothers you that much stop reading it And look into professional help for your deep seated anxiety about things you can t control 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul  7 04:30:20 2018|17|It didn t in a month It did incrementally and it just started to be noticeable now 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul  7 00:17:18 2018|12|Your vagina may have changed a bit and needs a different size 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 22:20:08 2018|59|It seems like you are making her having a baby about your feelings She probably has tons of stuff from people and doesn t need any more clutter In a few months maybe she would be happy to have an offer of diapers but I don t doubt that right now she is up to her ears in them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 21:06:23 2018|75|I prefer female bosses my current boss is a woman younger than me and she s awesome but as far as work equals I don t prefer men or women From my observations and experience completely generalizing Women as a whole tend to be cliquey about things and men tend to be really whiny when things dont go their way There s good and bad from each group so I don t have a preference 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 17:18:37 2018|33|I m not mocking you I m showing you how ridiculous you sound rationalizing this shit Obviously calm and rational explanation hasn t gotten through to you so what other options are there 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 17:11:16 2018|14|And fucking choking you nah not very extreme you re right take your time 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 17:05:47 2018|61|Yea because throwing a rabbit around definitely can t kill it Great plan and logic You has to ask if his behavior was bad enough to leave your parameters of what is extreme are so off but fine keep the animals in danger I hope when he kills them it s quick so they don t have to suffer any longer 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 16:49:23 2018|14|The next week or so gives him a week or so to kill them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 16:26:29 2018|30|Except it s a sub about women and their experiences There s like hundreds of subs for men or both men and women Why co opt one specifically for women 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 16:26:16 2018|30|Except it s a sub about women and their experiences There s like hundreds of subs for men or both men and women Why co opt one specifically for women 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 16:09:51 2018|17|If you re a guy and he s a guy how is that relevant to this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 16:04:02 2018|13|Maybe because you are downvoting anyone whose comments don t fit your narrative 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 15:08:12 2018|10|Having them affect me being horrified is giving them power 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 14:52:21 2018|29|Sure I usually get comments or shouts but I guess I have never considered it horrifying I don t really feel like giving that kind of power to people 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 06:12:08 2018|7|You need to give away the animals 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul  6 06:00:25 2018|24|Your husband is a fucking monster Leave him and stop with your I m not sure bullshit You know damn well it s abuse

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 23:01:28 2018|15|Are you here for advice or just to argue with anyone who empathizes with her 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 22:37:03 2018|68|You seem to be framing this completely around yourself when it s pretty obvious she s got a lot more going on than planning your wedding She s struggling Just because you aren t doesn t mean her struggles are due to comparing herself to you Give her some time and in a week if no answer discuss with her husband whether you should find a different MoH 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 18:59:50 2018|14|They re so few and far between I d always default to believing first 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 18:58:29 2018|3|Yes they do 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 18:41:14 2018|24|I love when people who are trying to understand women show their misogyny the moment someone says something that doesn t agree with them 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 18:20:59 2018|4|How fragile of you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 18:12:12 2018|21|Nothing wrong with asking questions I told you my opinion about how your comments and questions have progressed in the thread 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 18:04:58 2018|30|I don t think having an understanding of women s issues is synonymous with needing to know the exact details of how a woman s flow emerges from her vagina 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 17:59:00 2018|12|No I go to the bathroom and see it when I wipe 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 17:48:53 2018|19|I know I have my period when there is blood coming out of my vagina Pretty solid telltale sign 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 16:46:20 2018|74|Was she pregnant during the two semesters she failed I am not sure why her pregnancy relates at all to whether or not she passes your class I don t think giving her special consideration beyond certain physical aspects as you should be doing with anyone who has a temporary or permanent disability would be the right or professional thing to do Treat her like any other student her pregnancy isn t your business 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 16:02:44 2018|42|Why does she need your help Does she have no family or support system If it s hot and she feels faint get her some water and let her use a fan Hopefully that s what you d do for anyone though

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul  5 02:01:44 2018|35|I didn t celebrate the country today but I did celebrate the people in it I live in an extremely diverse area and showed my appreciation for those around me and I m not ashamed

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul  4 16:43:13 2018|14|Yes same here which is why I didn t think this was new info 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul  4 14:54:56 2018|34|What I mean is it doesn t seem like this is a new information It s been known for a long time that people around babies need TDap Maybe the specific numbers are new 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul  4 14:34:26 2018|30|Is that a new study I m pretty sure it s been a long time that they ve suggested moms and anyone else around the baby should get a TDap 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul  4 14:28:28 2018|24|You don t understand why people never dying on an already overpopulated planet with millions of people being born every day is a problem

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul  4 00:43:01 2018|143|The person on the phone was definitely inappropriate but depending on the state you can get into legal issues if you post a recording of a phone conversation that was recorded without someone s consent As far as the fitting goes that is what happens during bra fittings I don t think it s protocol at any establishment to ask for consent before each step It s common knowledge that when you are getting fitted for a bra or anything for that matter that you will be touched by the person who is fitting you If you were being fitted for pants there would be hands on and around your butt and thighs too I m sorry it made you uncomfortable but the salesperson was just doing her job Trying to hit her with a sexual assault charge is extremely unfair to her 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jul  4 00:28:20 2018|27|I d imagine when someone requests help getting size for a bra that would be considered implied consent for ya know sizing the bra Which involves touching 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 22:12:59 2018|62|I m not assuming she does I m implying that she should Considering yearly preventative exams are generally covered by insurance whether or not you ve hit your deductible and urgent care visits aren t it s just a good idea all around And chlamydia gonorrhea is considered part of the yearly preventive exam by most insurances rather than an extra cost 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 19:58:11 2018|33|No we generally don t get annoyed by having to do our jobs when we are at work Stop making excuses for a bitchy NP She was just a jerk that s all 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 19:22:48 2018|84|They re still capable of triage Emergent cases people who need care right away are seen immediately docs step out of the room and then sent to the ED Wanting a blood test doesn t have an effect on the NP or docs because they re not the ones drawing the blood And there aren t many urgent care settings where the lab techs have a constant stream of people to draw blood from where it s going to be tying up their resources 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 19:02:18 2018|15|I worked in urgent care no one gives a shit A patient s a patient 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 18:56:18 2018|11|Urgent care is just a walk in clinic not an ER

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 17:32:36 2018|46|You should feel anxious about it though He s not a good guy A caring person wouldn t coerce you into having unsafe sex in the first place You ve shown him he can manipulate you to do things as long as he acts remorseful afterwards 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 16:46:34 2018|33|But you re discussing the future with the possibility of laws changing Considering those laws may change why are you assuming or making plans based on the idea that other laws won t 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 16:41:14 2018|68|One can teach girls that models wear makeup without being an enormously insecure and hateful asshole about their existence though Supporting people like OP who are incapable of critiquing beauty standards without being hateful bitter and full of contempt just drives a bigger rift between people and sets forth the message that being an asshole about someone s looks is okay as long as they re good looking 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 16:00:53 2018|133|Her heart is the right place She s just spewed numerous paragraphs of hateful rhetoric about women for being attractive and making a career out of it It s no worse than campaigns by companies like Dove saying that regular women are attractive too Except that those campaigns don t say things like They all look the same tall bronzed how can caucasians even get that tan plump lips perfect teeth extremely skinny and perky C cups which is biological hypocrisy obviously they are fake or Oh nice do you want an award It s not groundbreaking that it takes you an hour to do your makeup because we know about women who are more objectively good looking than others They re included in those campaigns too because they are also REGULAR women 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 15:44:04 2018|29|It s a relevant piece to the story Makes it sound like you re trying to accuse your ex of sexual assault when he didn t sexually assault you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 15:30:05 2018|30|You guys got into the heat of things and he tried to move it along You said no and he stopped what part of that is sexual assault to you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 15:26:41 2018|16|Not really any way to know at this point It depends on how the laws change 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 13:53:04 2018|40|It actually worries me that she teaches young girls She seems to be implying that girls and women should be ashamed and not proud of being attractive or having a good life because it might make mentally unsound people uncomfortable 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 13:50:45 2018|21|The shame here is that you re implying that being good looking is something women should feel bad about and hide 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 13:49:12 2018|23|Honestly if you have such severe mental health issues it probably isn t safe for you to be teaching such impressionable young girls 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 03:54:56 2018|13|Good looking people in the public eye have almost always been a thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul  2 23:23:16 2018|51|The general demographic of Reddit does not include people who would have had pregnancies before Roe vs Wade You may get a few responses and some secondhand accounts but if you re looking for a lot of answers you may want to find a site that doesn t skew so young

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  1 13:27:33 2018|38|Then people would either be dying of trauma cancer etc or not dying at all I don t know why I m surprised about this but do you really not understand why that s a bad thing Really 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  1 06:13:39 2018|20|Yes I instantly dismiss Slate articles from many years ago in preference for current events This is a true statement 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  1 06:03:20 2018|24|Yea silly me A six year old opinion piece from slate com is definitely in the league of classic literature what was I thinking 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  1 06:01:45 2018|19|Does the UN definition of murder differ from the legal definition of murder and every dictionary definition of murder 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  1 05:48:27 2018|18|It doesn t suggest murdering them It suggests making it legal to kill them which isn t murder 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  1 05:30:36 2018|63|You understand that is what happens when people die of old age right One or more organs fail If organs never failed people wouldn t die of natural causes So are you saying we should eliminate the possibility of dying from natural causes Of organs don t fail do we just kill people at a certain point What s the end goal here 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  1 05:22:24 2018|17|My opinion is that I don t care about a sensationalist clickbait article from six years ago 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jul  1 05:15:58 2018|13|Threading yields great results actually I much prefer it over waxing or tweezing

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 18:17:36 2018|37| However I would prefer that my physical condition not take a nosedive off a cliff due to what amounts to organ failure I d imagine people who experience other organs failing with age feel the same way 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 17:46:47 2018|16|But you just argued that the problem isn t natural because of how other species age 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 15:35:40 2018|23|You measure whether something is natural or not based on whether other species also experience it That s not really how things work 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 05:15:20 2018|18|I know it happens in real life I m sorry you had trouble comprehending the sentences I wrote 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 01:22:18 2018|17|Nothing wrong with being on Reddit Relying on Reddit for actual constructive conversation on the other hand 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 01:10:20 2018|60|I didn t say you didn t have a life but apparently that hit a sore spot for you I said if conversation matters so much to you and your only way of getting it is going on Reddit you need to broaden your horizons because there are a lot more ways to have constructive conversations than posting on Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 01:08:12 2018|48| Reddit isn t just a random pointless website It really is If people are going to form their opinions based on what a bunch of Redditors think they are extremely easily swayed and will be the same way in real life with whoever they choose to latch onto 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 00:54:17 2018|75|It s a good thing downvotes mean literally nothing and are inconsequential to your existence and well being then Not to mention they have less to do with Reddit having more male users and more to do with anonymity There are a lot of shitty dudes on this site But there are also a lot of shitty ladies If you rely on Reddit for meaningful conversation I think it s time to broaden your horizons 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 00:31:27 2018|9|How does that relate to being outnumbered by men 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 00:24:05 2018|35|I can t imagine ever caring enough to notice honestly We re outnumbered by men on a random pointless website Oh well I m more concerned being outnumbered by men in stuff that actually matters 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 30 00:19:49 2018|21|I guess since he did it twice maybe but that would be playing pretty fast and loose with a serious term 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 28 16:15:37 2018|19|Then I m sure you can provide plenty of unbiased sources since it s such a widely recognized fact 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 28 16:09:19 2018|16|Just because you are saying it doesn t make it accurate But this is Reddit afterall 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 28 16:06:14 2018|23|It means that in English too OP probably is feeling a bit raw and taking things personally despite it being an accurate term

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 28 05:01:35 2018|31|They should link the original study which clarified that it surveyed experts not including any information on their demographics on their perception of countries Nothing more than an opinion poll Yawn 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 28 04:58:26 2018|20|This was posted yesterday It s an opinion poll on the perception of people vaguely described as experts Clickbait nonsense

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 28 02:04:42 2018|41|No I understand what it feels like I just don t know why you wouldn t consider that an apt response to trashiness when the simple solution would be for OP to just not wear her underwear outside of her clothing 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 28 01:09:40 2018|75| was wearing them to dinner at an upscale resteraunt and I guess the back of my thong was accidentily sticking out above my pants I didn t think that much of it thats just another way to wear thongsMaybe if you live on a trailer park or were raised by wolves I d be mortified if my daughter s thong was sticking out at any restaurant let alone an upscale one Have some self respect 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 28 01:07:05 2018|32| I m sorry are you seriously suggesting making her walk around in public with underwear that is uncomfortably small and irritating is really a solution It made an impact didn t it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 21:44:44 2018|29|Yea I think 6 8 is a good age as long as they ve been raised from a very young age to know how to be gentle with dogs 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 21:40:23 2018|105|I love your username And I agree minus the big thing I worked with dogs for a decade and work in pediatrics now I love and adore big dogs but when it boils down to it dogs are animals I d never trust training 100 over instinct and I d never been comfortable with a giant creature next to a tiny creature on the off chance the giant creature could be spooked and literally kill the tiny one with one bite Small dogs and medium dogs bite too but it s a lot less likely for them to kill a little person with one chomp 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 21:34:30 2018|27|So OP assuming that the computer system defaults to the husband s name and requesting that they change that isn t reasonably looking for a legitimate error 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 19:29:38 2018|12|How can you make that definitive statement Oh yea you can t 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 19:21:17 2018|12|What exactly do you think the word fought is past tense for 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 17:30:37 2018|52|I just looked at the posting history That s a poster who has had at least 50 names Gets banned ban evades gets suspended Rinse and repeat I have a list somewhere I know she is currently here as u unempress too unless that one got banned Point is don t bother 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 17:19:55 2018|57|I think as a whole it is misrepresented on all ends The media MRAs etc all seem to intentionally misrepresent it but there are a lot of people who do represent it that give it a bad name as well and they re the people that the former points to when talking about why feminism is bad 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 15:32:07 2018|18|How is that relevant to what OP is asking There are women here and he is addressing women

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 01:12:30 2018|16|I wasn t joking I meant it but you re right it was mean I apologize 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 01:06:07 2018|25|You d think You d at least make an attempt to be a nicer person after your boyfriend intentionally overdosed to get away from you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 00:52:29 2018|70|Thankfully my decade in the service industry and another decade in the medical field has proven to be very different than your teenage job that made you such an expert I suppose being a complete garbage person you d be more inclined to surround yourself with garbage people though so it makes sense I can t imagine why you re having trouble finding a job now It s a mystery 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 00:49:23 2018|15|No not really They re just being hyperbolic or they live a very sheltered life 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 00:47:01 2018|28|Not a very ethical business practice to not tell them your food isn t vegan when they specifically mentioned their dietary preferences Congrats on being a shitty person 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 00:42:26 2018|11|Most pizza dough and pasta is flour yeast water oil salt 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 00:38:37 2018|62|I just saw that you re 22 Of course you wouldn t be aware of things older than 5 years ago You were a child As I said I ve been using vegan makeup products and they ve been easily accessible for 20 years I don t think that suddenly after another couple years they ll be a hard to find commodity 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun 27 00:33:06 2018|21|I like when people call things phases just because they were clueless to the existence of something before a certain point 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 23:34:29 2018|18|Vegan phase Must be a really long one because I ve been using vegan products for 20 years 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 23:28:50 2018|25|Meh you re talking about WA state like it s all Seattle There s plenty of extremely affordable stuff not in the Puget Sound area 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 18:03:55 2018|37|I don t disagree that those people and the administration sucks but you have to be wearing blinders or have an extremely USA centric mentality to think this is even close to the worst country for anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 17:19:56 2018|36|I m not getting involved in your but were you really sexually assaulted diatribe You are on the opposite end of the spectrum from people using something like this as gospel but you re terrible too 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 17:14:33 2018|23|Yea it wasn t even really clear what qualifies these people as experts Unless I missed the description somewhere It was pretty vague 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 17:09:57 2018|57|I did read the article They took the opinion of 500 experts It s a small sample size Not to mention even experts don t have experience or knowledge of the goings on of all countries and are certain to show some form of bias It s not like it s statistics it s an opinion poll 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 17:03:01 2018|22| She is just some bored boy trying to make women look bad I thought that was pretty obvious but I guess not 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 17:01:08 2018|9|And y all are pretty awful at spotting trolls 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 16:57:00 2018|18|Sorry I don t like the US in most ways but that s a load of straight bullshit 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 14:51:20 2018|7|You re setting the bar really low 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 14:08:20 2018|2| colored peopleWoof
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 14:07:36 2018|6|That doesn t answer my question 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 14:05:44 2018|54|I m not trying to be rude but why do you think anyone would care to read something like that Lots of people are ugly The real issue arises when that s the only way you define yourself Which is pretty much what you d be doing by writing a memoir about being ugly 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 26 13:26:58 2018|8|Why is he one of your best friends 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 19:22:39 2018|30|STD tests aren t always standard for yearly check ups Chlamydia and gonorrhea are usually included but not always and anything beyond that is not normal for a yearly exam 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 19:17:54 2018|38|With most insurances a well woman visit would generally cover the normal things done in a well woman exam and anything extra such as treatment for BV blood tests etc would not be covered in the same way 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 19:14:29 2018|106|I don t understand the issue here Would you have preferred that she tell you you should be worrying about it and it s necessary to get it removed when neither of those are true It wasn t a medically necessary procedure It s her job as a doctor to let you know that You opted to still get it done and she did it Closing the hole after it opened wasn t medically necessary It s her job as a doctor to let you know that You opted to have it closed and she did it I don t see where she did anything wrong 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 16:41:20 2018|73|Are all y all completely incapable of wrapping your mind around more than one concept at once We can teach people to be safe AND teach people about consent We can do both of those things Mind blowing I know Teaching people not to rape doesn t make rapists disappear Not teaching people to be careful just needlessly puts them in vulnerable positions when a few simple tips could keep them much safer 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 15:30:44 2018|10|That s obnoxious Please don t teach your daughter that 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 12:17:56 2018|19|Totally We should definitely stop teaching people how to be safe because of those things You re totally right 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 05:12:36 2018|44|I d read through the comments if I were you because that s exactly what people are arguing that we shouldn t be teaching women to be safe because men should be taught not to rape As if the two things are mutually exclusive 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 03:54:12 2018|84|My comment was about how teaching women tips and tricks to make themselves safer isn t victim blaming You asked why we can t teach boys not to rape which has nothing to do with whether teaching women tips and tricks to be safer is victim blaming or not I said they can both mutually exist You went off on your own tangent about not teaching boys to rape Further straying from the topic of whether teaching women safety is victim blaming or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 03:46:16 2018|25|Cool not sure why you think that negates anything I was talking about but thumbs up Sounds like you re trying to change the subject 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 03:05:06 2018|11|Where did I say people shouldn t be taught to rape 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 02:50:49 2018|75|The car crash thing Anyone in law enforcement lawyers and judges know that eyewitness accounts are very rarely accurate They can be used as evidence but it s very hard to prove them 100 true because usually they aren t The mind is a weird thing and fills in gaps with stuff It s pretty interesting Look into it Also a really funny movie regarding that among other things is My Cousin Vinny Highly suggested 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 02:38:15 2018|26|Yeah Is that a real question If you re going to have such a strong opinion on things at least know what you re talking about 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 01:53:51 2018|12|There is a difference between female circumcision and FGM two different procedures 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 01:53:02 2018|11|There are reasons to do it though There are medical conditions 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 01:48:28 2018|2|Medical necessity 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun 25 01:45:56 2018|6|Circumcision is acceptable in some cases 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 24 21:30:34 2018|25|Yea not for everything but I often get told that the house looks nice if not an actual thank you I thank my husband too 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 24 21:27:52 2018|4|I go to Target 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 24 20:15:03 2018|61|Teaching boys not to be rapists doesn t make rapists magically disappear We can teach people not to be rapists but that doesn t mean we shouldn t teach people tips and tricks for being safe Dangers exist Leaving people unprepared for this dangers because they shouldn t exist is just foolish And I agree everyone should be taught self defense 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 24 19:21:47 2018|81|Giving women tips and tricks to be safer isn t victim blaming Saying well why didn t you xyz to avoid being raped is We can teach people ways to be safer in situations while also not blaming them if something does happen If there weren t any rapists and everyone raised non rapist kids safety tips wouldn t be needed But not giving safety tips doesn t magically make rapists disappear It just puts us more at risk to them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 24 19:17:42 2018|45|Why is that a bad lesson to be taught Sorry women get roofied It doesn t make it their fault but it s not bad practice or victim blaming to give them tips and tricks on how to be safer and hopefully avoid that situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 24 16:28:40 2018|128|People need to be taught self defense and how to lessen their likelihood of being a victim Regardless of whether it should be on us to protect ourselves from evil shitheads the fact is it has to be In a utopian world where kids are taught not to rape and it sticks with every single one of them and they grow up to be not rapists and raise not rapist kids yes this would be unnecessary and perpetuating bad ideas However we don t live in that world and we need to know how to protect ourselves The worst part of this story is that the boys didn t get to learn valuable self defense tools and they are at a higher risk of Stranger Danger than us 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 21:02:27 2018|43|OP says opinions not facts No one s opinions are set in stone especially not teenagers and people in their early 20s so I m not going to treat them as such The amount of change between age 18 and 25 is enormous 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 19:09:02 2018|37|That s not really a logical conclusion to draw based on that fact and it is a fact not sure why that hurts your feelings but sure if that s how you want to process it cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 18:14:52 2018|29|To be fair your brain isn t really done developing until you re 25 26ish so I will always take people under that age with a grain of salt 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 18:12:51 2018|7|She doesn t care End of story 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 17:12:50 2018|12|That s not very safe You should be aware of your surroundings 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 16:49:24 2018|38|Attempting to enter the country is a civil offense not a criminal offense People generally don t have their kids taken away from them indefinitely without trial for committing a breach on contract or damaging someone s property 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 16:41:53 2018|29|I just make sure to smile whenever I am being idle and I think about it I work with children and it s pretty easy to smile around them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 16:39:49 2018|19|He used the word female in the correct context as an adjective to describe his acquaintance not a noun 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 13:56:12 2018|10|You sound really uncomfortable with sex and the human body 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 06:15:48 2018|38|If he won t submit a refill when she runs out of pills from skipping placebo week that pretty much forcing her to take it or go unprotected for three weeks at the end of each prescription cycle 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 00:59:11 2018|29|I wouldn t say it s the best decision but there are people in a lot worse situations who choose to have kids so whatever Does your spouse drive 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 22 00:56:42 2018|17|But most of them also have the ability to drive or take public transit in emergency circumstances 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 21 22:41:48 2018|21|You planting the idea in OP s head that men are unable to say how they feel just perpetuates that stereotype 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 21 22:35:57 2018|11|Or he realized that he doesn t want a kid yet 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 21 22:31:36 2018|24|You can feel however you want to feel but he isn t wrong for voicing his opinion about not being ready for a child 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 21 15:43:13 2018|12|I thought maybe it was a colloquial term for the nether regions 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 20:48:40 2018|63|According to the sub mods Father s Day posts aren t relevant here Even if we are women discussing our positive experiences with our fathers This must be doubly the case when it comes to a man posting about it Father s Day Although you re writing about a bad father so maybe they ll allow it since it reflects poorly on men 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 15:08:30 2018|45|Haircutting is kind of in the gray area of being the Pink Tax or not There are a lot of factors to take into account Either way I think it s good to include that in this discussion because it is in the same realm 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 15:04:49 2018|101|That would be great if we were able to do that And actually we can if we rent a chair We do it for color so why not for cuts too But he does bring up a good point that if she started with longer hair it would be more work to cut it short It also depends on whether she wanted more texture styling etc there are a lot of nuances to hair In the end though most places have to charge based on generalities unfortunately because it d be damn near impossible to customize for each and every person 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 14:10:51 2018|10|Well that s good Why are you arguing about then 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 14:02:27 2018|73|If you like to get buzzed and don t like blacking out then it seems you didn t make the conscious choice to get black out drunk which means you have trouble controlling how much you drink You re getting combative and defensive No one here is saying what he did was okay but there are numerous facets to recovering from this and getting help for your drinking problem is one of them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 13:47:39 2018|106|So when your husband is out of your life and you get black out drunk again you don t foresee a problem surfacing Are new men in your life supposed to know that when you beg for sex you re not begging for sex Your husband knows and breached that trust but no one else is going to know that begging for sex doesn t mean you want sex So either stop drinking so that you don t risk getting black out drunk since you don t know your limits or wait for this to happen again with a new person Because it most likely will 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 13:37:57 2018|19|If you drink the blackout and then beg for things you don t want that is a drinking problem

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 13:09:46 2018|101|About breastfeeding which is what you asked for A breastfeeding video that shows more than a baby s head I gave you four You d have a tougher time finding a video that doesn t show a breast honestly I work two days a week at a breast feeding center and the other two at a peds clinic Your inability to admit you were wrong made me realize you re that homebound mentally ill user who continually gets suspended and makes new usernames though So this is par for the course I hope one day you find the help you need

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 05:45:24 2018|61|It could be a lot of things Too much sugar from too much grape juice The combo of that much sugar and the weed Norovirus fluctuating hormones I mean it s not impossible that they drugged you but that seems like a nefarious conclusion to jump to what would they even do to you at your house with your bf present 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 02:49:37 2018|9|There s a few more for you my friend 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 01:59:00 2018|3|Newborns aren t 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun 17 01:27:10 2018|14|Sure here is literally the first video that comes up when I googled breastfeeding 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 20:53:43 2018|42|If the baby is big enough the breast is small enough they never move their head or release the nipple and the woman has small ish areolae then yea a baby would be covering the breast during the entirety of the video 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 20:40:58 2018|16|That s interesting Must not have a big sample size or seen things from many angles 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 20:30:25 2018|18|I see breastfeeding women dozens of times a week and I definitely see more than just a baby 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 17:52:08 2018|24|I guess so in the same way childbirth videos should be too Nothing bad or inappropriate about it but probably not good at work 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 16:27:15 2018|25| I didn t actually read the post but now I feel dumb so I m going to pretend like I just think they re lying 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 16:26:36 2018|78|I m telling you the Cosby Show a show that created a black family to be specifically palatable to white audiences was extremely polarizing in the black community so it s not outlandish to expect a black person stop showing support for Cosby after he was convicted of raping women You re acting like he was some beacon and God to the black community and deciding to revoke support from him is some kind of betrayal to blackness 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 16:10:52 2018|21|Also OP wrote an entire paragraph on being black and being in the black community But yea definitely white great guess 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 16:01:46 2018|67|Bill Cosby was extremely critical and alienating of a large portion of the black community and perpetuated the ideas of institutionalized racism All he did was give white people a black guy to point to and say see He agrees with me when they go on racist diatribes about any black people who don t completely strip their personality and demeanor of any semblance of their heritage 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 16 15:53:35 2018|41|Men are former boys who were raised by both women and men sometimes one or the other It s everyone s job to be aware what boys are learning and retaining By the time they re men the damage is done

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 15 14:07:23 2018|27|Maybe at your wedding that was part of the deal but that doesn t extend to all weddings Not that what the groom did was ok though 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 15 06:02:46 2018|8|It s like no one read the study 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 15 05:59:22 2018|18|I thought the point of a comment section about a study was to discuss the study Oh well 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 15 05:57:38 2018|7|That wasn t a response to you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 15 05:55:22 2018|47|The people on the study weren t the ones sending or receiving the text messages They were on the outside reading the exchange They were mixed gender equally and the study was to see their perception from the outside not how they felt personally receiving that text 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 15 05:49:40 2018|33|The study isn t really about women feeling harassed or not It s about societal perception of how the exact same conduct can be perceived very differently depending on who is doing it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 15 05:44:55 2018|1|Backpedaling 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun 15 05:40:49 2018|9|I like how neither of you read the study

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun 14 21:18:36 2018|16|Your history makes me think this isn t an earnest question but yes it is rape

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  8 20:35:00 2018|6|She doesn t have social security 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  8 15:36:05 2018|11|Everyone gets judged for everything Just do what you wanna do 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  8 15:00:44 2018|20|Sure I have a story like that except he didn t move on to a new person he died instead 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  8 14:16:05 2018|14|I didn t delete my comment It likely got removed because someone reported it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  8 14:00:51 2018|47|Dude was just pronounced dead and Kate Spade died a few days ago The selfish comments come with any suicide He s barely been known dead long enough to get them yet Pump your brakes and have some of the respect your implying the other people lack 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  8 13:51:42 2018|22|Anybody notice how OP is immediately turning the tragic deaths of two influential people into a posing contest about her own agenda 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  8 06:16:35 2018|27|Out of curiosity why do you think a menstrual cup would cause that And to answer your question no I ve been using one since 2015 2016 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 22:58:58 2018|28|No that s how you interpreted it I don t particularly care anymore though so sure I m totally wrong and you re totally right Dumb dumb me 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 22:42:35 2018|35|Can you show me where I said almost all Basic cardio and yoga comprises a lot of exercises But ask an OB how they feel about you doing burpees bouldering and squat jumps while pregnant 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 20:39:37 2018|6|Lol look at his post history 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 20:00:07 2018|13|To answer your question childbirth and being the default stay at home parent 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 17:31:27 2018|64|You know people would complain if doctors defaulted automatically to telling them how to prepare for pregnancy if they have no intention of ever being pregnant If you ask a doctor what you can do to prepare for getting pregnant they will tell you Giving that information without any sign that someone is looking to get pregnant will just offend a bunch of people 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 17:04:23 2018|21| some modification to exercise routines may be necessary because of normal anatomic and physiologic changes and fetal requirements From the link 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 15:20:57 2018|26|I post random dog memes on his FB and he comments on my posts like once a year I m much more active than he is 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 15:17:08 2018|21|They almost always insist on a tubal with ablation to eliminate any possibility of pregnancy because it can cause uterine prolapse 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 15:16:08 2018|31|I had an ablation and Essure at 22 for the same reason PM me if you want and I can answer any questions though the age difference may change some things 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 14:07:12 2018|28|No exercising as normal isn t really right Anything beyond mostly basic cardio and yoga needs to be modified for the safety of the mom and the baby 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 14:04:20 2018|39|If you ve never been pregnant or worked in a doc s office with pregnant women I don t think you have any idea of what they do or don t do to prepare women for pregnancy and childbirth 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 14:03:02 2018|14|Most docs suggest obese people lose weight if they re planning on getting pregnant 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 14:01:26 2018|5|Don t douche Never douche 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 03:40:32 2018|92| Poor blacks need to be encouraged to vote then and when if fuckery happens at the voting booth and valid voters get turned away people need to speak up about it Those with privilege who are interested can try implementing a program to transport them to voting centers get a petition to allow mail in voting etc The voting system isn t flawless by any means but changing it to something like the electoral college isn t really the way to make it more fair I mean look at the presidential election 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 03:16:09 2018|38|If the person who wins the popular vote is the one who gets the seat I am okay with whatever they choose It s unfortunate that the majority would vote for a shithead but it is their voice 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 02:37:48 2018|36|He s 100 a certain ethnicity and I m a cacophony if numerous ethnicities The last name will match the kid s ethnicity more Plus husband is pretty traditional and I didn t care that much 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 01:31:02 2018|25|I did I don t like hyphenated names and I wanted to have the same name as my kid when we decide to have one 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 01:14:17 2018|20|I saw women doing that on the one for men though too People get defensive about stuff for whatever reason 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jun  7 01:06:41 2018|1|Good 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun  6 21:44:55 2018|4|Gardasil 9 already exists 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun  6 16:26:51 2018|10|Considering you are posting here I think you re right 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun  6 14:33:28 2018|20|I don t really think it did an effective job of dispelling either of those tbh It kept contradicting them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun  6 05:14:12 2018|5|What is wrong with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jun  6 05:12:34 2018|40|I don t really care Looks are looks their not hurting me in any way If they say something or touch me that is a different story But staring just makes them look dumb and has no effect on me

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 23:07:16 2018|24|No no basing your final decision about whether or not to kill someone on a man telling you he loves you THAT s feminist 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 23:01:06 2018|5|No it s not rude 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 22:59:51 2018|44|I have more of an issue with what passes as feminist in forms of media than anything else Like the fact that Wonder Woman was considered a triumph for women was really pathetic It did nothing to abolish any tropes of women in movies 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 18:50:31 2018|4|Nah you re not 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 18:47:34 2018|54| I don t see that implication at all That s the fun thing about music different people interpret things differently I don t even see any indication that the singer is a man Could just as easily be a woman singing this song About how she s a man and not a boy Okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 18:45:05 2018|1|Perspective 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 18:33:16 2018|10|Was my last comment confusing to you in some way 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 18:20:01 2018|37|I didn t say I have a problem with it All I said is that it s more of the same and doesn t deserve any recognition as some kind of special song with a progressive message 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 18:15:40 2018|40|I guess I can t really respond if you don t see the very heavily implied idea in the lyrics that he s trying to show her what a real man is in order to get with her Oh well 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 18:04:49 2018|19|Which still boils down to only helping someone out with the hope that eventually you ll get to fuck 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 18:02:43 2018|32|No I m saying that making a song that still ultimately boils down to so now we can bone right shouldn t really incite a pat on the back for being progressive 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 16:43:06 2018|32|Is it a difficult task in your mind to just write lyrics that don t insinuate you re trying to fuck someone without explicitly saying you re not trying to fuck them 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 15:48:06 2018|18|Orrrrrr Take her home and leave without the intent of trying to eventually stick your dick in her 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 14:05:35 2018|15|Mother Teresa was a piece of shit so I hope that s not the case 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 14:03:18 2018|28|It s still a little weird that it s got cause then she will probably want to fuck you once she s sobered up as the underlying theme 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun  5 02:53:33 2018|34|Losing weight during the first trimester is very common so don t let that discourage you As far as the rest only time will tell but I hope for the best possible outcome 3
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 23:41:05 2018|80|It s a supply and demand thing More people choose to dress their kids in a certain way so that s what they supply for that gender Just buy the girl s clothes in the boy s section if that s what she likes and vice versa On a related note My friends did their best to keep things open for their little girl to choose whatever she wanted and she was still more drawn to tutus and Frozen dolls 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 20:53:33 2018|9|She probably doesn t know your history with him 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 17:50:47 2018|24|I certainly am Perhaps when you re a grown ass woman you will have developed your ability to have a discussion Til then peace 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 17:31:20 2018|4|You are definitely 17 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 17:18:45 2018|24| other than Niki Minaj I can t really think of any other female rappers that go to all the big festivals they go to
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 16:52:35 2018|67|Your argument was that Nicki Minaj and Cardi B are the only two female rappers that play big shows and festivals and I just named a bunch of others yet you keep arguing with me Salt N Pepa currently sell out amphitheaters and Missy Elliott played the Super Bowl Just because you are under educated about women in hip hop doesn t magically make these people irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 16:24:25 2018|32|None of these other artists would exist in the way they do without the influence from Salt N Pepa etc that s like saying the Beatles aren t relevant to rock music 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 16:20:48 2018|28|I m not sure why you re getting so defensive but no he wasn t OJ s lawyer He was his friend who happened to be a lawyer 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 15:25:10 2018|43|KK s father was OJ Simpson s BFF during the trial and Kris Jenner KK s mother was married to Olympian Bruce Jenner now Caitlyn Jenner You thought the family just randomly got their giant mansion after Kim had a sex tape released 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 15:21:16 2018|16|Wow the time has come when hip hop fans haven t heard of Salt N Pepa 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 13:56:18 2018|31|Salt N Pepa Missy Elliott Lauryn Hill Lil Kim Eve MIA Snow Tha Product Queen Latifah Lizzo all have played or do play big festivals and half of them act ghetto 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 13:47:45 2018|34|You re a kiddo so I ll let you know starting a conversation doesn t mean people are going to agree with you That s how you learn new things and develop new opinions 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 13:34:47 2018|45|It sounds like he was treating you as a buddy and just busting your chops Likely means he considers you a friend but if you don t like that sort of thing you can find friends that don t joke around with you like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 13:26:28 2018|1|No 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 13:21:26 2018|1|He

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 02:23:34 2018|2|Like 76 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jun  4 00:29:45 2018|29|There are hundreds of blogs message boards and articles that discuss this at length It s not some new little known taboo phenomenon that people don t talk about 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun  3 22:58:24 2018|81| Maybe he ruined their evening maybe something else It didn t seem bad enough though for her to put his life in danger and if he does that regularly If he ruins the majority of their nights out with his drinking How many times is she supposed to sit around and take it or calmly direct him home Everyone has a breaking point and the majority of times I see something like this happen it s because someone has reached theirs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun  3 19:54:32 2018|34|Since when have acting ghetto and being a good rapper been mutually exclusive That tends to come with the territory a lot of the time so I m not sure why it s surprising 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun  3 17:25:29 2018|44|Don t equate Kim Kardashian to people who started from nothing She s rich and has always been rich and her family was famous before her sex tape If we re talking about working for one s fame and fortune she doesn t qualify 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun  3 15:29:54 2018|109|Overall shittiness no I ve had a lot of bad stuff happen to me but it s my choice whether to make it a focal point of my experience as a woman and I ve chosen not to do that That s a privilege I am grateful for and will never not take advantage of it I d never give the power to the abusers and harassers and consider my life overall shitty That said I have lived all around the US and have been catcalled or harassed on a semi regular basis I have been assaulted and I ve been mansplained though I hate that phrase a bunch 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jun  3 04:32:23 2018|10|Most things I love being a woman it s awesome 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun  2 16:09:31 2018|35|I was a hairstylist for a decade forgive me if I m not going to waste any more of my time arguing with a random person on Reddit about what I did for a living 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun  2 15:57:54 2018|42|If you don t get your hair washed or dried during a haircut you generally aren t going to be charged for it If you are then you should go elsewhere Is more time effort more cost a tough thing to understand 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun  2 15:41:20 2018|3|Nope not compatible 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun  2 15:28:20 2018|48| no long hair takes more time to cut so the cost is more That s why most salons specify long vs short as opposed to women vs men or base their price on time in the chair since lots of men have long hair and vice versa now 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun  2 08:02:26 2018|15|Everything you ve written thus far contradicts the claims you ve made in this comment 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun  2 07:47:49 2018|18|The word is voila so not only are you a terrible person but you re also an idiot 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun  2 07:42:05 2018|13|Also he literally wrote out walah like that s an actual fucking word 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun  2 07:39:44 2018|10|Walah Is this what the world has come to Wtf

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 21:56:22 2018|15|OB GYN or just a gynecologist An OB isn t really the focus she needs 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 21:54:19 2018|38|Youre 17 so it s it really uncommon to have an irregular period as a teenager But if you re worried you should see a gynecologist not an obstetrician So go to an OBGYN or just a gynecologist 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 21:53:01 2018|7|An OB is for pregnancy and childbirth 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 21:32:51 2018|24|I am a cis woman and none of that applies to me so don t worry It s not an experience all women have 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 20:57:42 2018|42|You can try negotiations Chances are he got hired at a higher rate to begin with as starting salaries likely rose in the four years you ve been working there so when he got promoted he ended up getting more Just ask 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 20:37:40 2018|79|I think it s a little unfair to say that the sunny side of girlhood is somehow inaccurate just because bad stuff happened too I got bullied and stuff as a kid but none of that defined my girlhood for me My mom sewing me pretty sundresses and me making my walk in closet into a giant Barbie house and collecting all the beanie babies in existence and playing house with all my stuffed animals that defined my girlhood 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 17:26:52 2018|86|Even if she does it when she s not pregnant her fat is different from your fat Just because she s not morbidly obese doesn t mean she can t discuss her issues with feeling overweight You need to examine why you re upset about this and figure out how to process it because getting bothered over someone else s body issues because they re not fat enough to have them and assuming they re doing it for attention isn t fair to anyone yourself included 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 17:13:03 2018|34|Everyone is fighting their own battles You don t know what s going on in her head She just had a baby and her hormones are all over the place Give her a break 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 16:58:31 2018|8|Hmm yea that s a tough one then 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 16:55:56 2018|37|THC stays in the system for a month You likely just drank too much None of that sounds out of character for just having way too much alcohol especially since they found nothing else in your system

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 14:07:23 2018|52|Childfree people tend to be annoying and sanctimonious about their views on children and parenthood despite being critical of breeders for being that way You re never going to have a workplace without nosy idiots so just be careful what you say and to whom It s really not their business anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 06:22:23 2018|22|Stay out of it It s got nothing to do with you anymore Keep your distance and move on from the drama

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 00:45:10 2018|24|So your ex manipulated you to think he wasn t garbage but there s no possibility your current boyfriend is doing the same thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 00:40:45 2018|41|You have the ability to change whether you re a loser or not you don t have control over others You can choose to keep running with them and being like them or you can make the choice to improve yourself 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 00:35:51 2018|37|You re trying to rationalize your choice to surround yourself with garbage people If you continue to do that your life is not going to change If you want to live like this forever then go ahead 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jun  1 00:31:43 2018|26|My advice is to stop dating losers I mean seriously a meth head ex and a boyfriend in prison Have some self respect and find better

TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 17:01:04 2018|21|Right so then why didn t he say I don t get pedicures since he was literally talking just about himself 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 17:00:20 2018|17|Eh she lived with us for a few years and went back The gravy train is over 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 16:56:44 2018|24|Why would he say Guys don t get pedicures first if he was specifically talking about his preference That doesn t make any sense 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 16:49:40 2018|24|I can see this happening to a family member of mine Unfortunately not much anyone can do if they don t want to leave

TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 15:37:32 2018|5|Ace of Spades M torhead
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 15:32:35 2018|58|The first step would be to find out whether she does or not If she does I don t see an issue If she doesn t you should suggest that she makes it known to her potential clients You can frame it in a way that makes it seem like you re concerned about patient feedback and reviews 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 15:21:43 2018|49|I wouldn t jump to breaking up yet But you do need to discuss it and try to figure out the root of the issue It s not going to be an easy talk but once things are out in the open it makes it easier to fix things 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 15:20:33 2018|34|Having a trip planned is definitely not a reason to stay together but I dunno if I d call it shallow and fake especially when she still genuinely likes him and enjoys his company 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 15:17:06 2018|20|Is she is a counselor through the church Does she advertise herself as a faith based counselor to potential clients 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 14:01:42 2018|46|If you need to have the exact same hypothetical reaction and feelings in a scenario as someone else in order to empathize with them I d say you re incapable of actual empathy There s no point in trying to explain things to people like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 13:31:30 2018|10|That sounds horrible I literally shuddered as I read that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 31 01:07:44 2018|32|Everything is a little shallow but I never understood why we shouldn t be a bit picky and shallow when choosing someone we will be with for the rest of our lives 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 22:36:44 2018|13|Uh did you miss the part where they no longer have a relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 22:29:19 2018|14|This sounds horrifying to me but by all means do what works for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 16:03:24 2018|20|You say you are taking ownership for what you said but then keep trying to downplay it and validate it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 14:50:31 2018|25|Yea I read your OP Like I said your rudeness was no excuse for his actions but it doesn t mean you weren t rude 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 05:47:08 2018|59|Clearly you and I have different ideas of how to acceptably interact with another human being If you want to just take the abuse that s your prerogative but it is absurd to argue that anyone has a right to do it I hope no one speaks to you as rudely as OP chose to speak to her driver 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 05:27:53 2018|49|The attitude that people are entitled to be assholes to service people is exactly why being in the service industry is so hard Having a shitty day is not an excuse to be rude to someone else It is absolutely not a right that anyone should feel they have 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 04:56:41 2018|11|She does not have the right to be unpleasant Absolutely not 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 04:55:19 2018|79|Uh she s just telling a story online I don t really need any proof from her But if she s going to lie about something I d imagine she would paint herself in a better picture than person who is an asshole to service people after a bad day If she is going to contact the police I m sure she has the driver s info time of the altercation etc All that gets stored in the app 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 04:47:09 2018|51|There s a big difference between saying I haven t had a great day and I want to go home vs what she said She doesn t have to fake feeling great but she doesn t have to be unpleasant and curse at someone who is doing her a service either 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 04:30:56 2018|21|Yea you were a total bitch to him but that doesn t excuse physical assault You should file a police report 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 23:47:19 2018|12|He s into her and emotionally cheating on you at this point 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 20:39:28 2018|23|I use both a diva cup and thinx Diva cup on medium days both on heavy days and thinx on light days Woo

TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 06:05:43 2018|66|Yep my good friend has two kiddos who are like 4 and 8 now but she and her husband traveled all over before kids and didn t stop after having them They ended up moving to Europe a few years ago and the kids go with them on weekend trips to France or Italy or wherever they decide to go I want them to adopt me 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 05:51:46 2018|49|Getting downvotes because people have the If I can t won t do it no one can will attitude People travel with kids Anyone who has ever been on an airplane or train ever in their life can see that It s silly to downvote someone for saying it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 02:52:05 2018|37|That s you again as I already said If OP wants both she can find a happy medium with both She doesn t have to choose between one or the other if she doesn t want to 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 02:21:28 2018|75|Wow I can t imagine your relationship with your sister recovering after you said such horrible stuff Sure it would have changed with the baby but you ve managed to mostly likely irreparably change it with your awful words first You don t exactly sound all that remorseful either as you keep trying to validate what you said So I m not sure how you will be able to apologize and make her believe it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 01:31:27 2018|16|But you re literally not paying for anything after the procedure No pills no packaging nothing 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 01:20:01 2018|36|People do do it though Which is my point If she s willing to take the proper steps she doesn t have to go 100 either way Anyhow some kids are just better behaved than others 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 01:18:11 2018|33|So birth control is a monthly cost and a vasectomy is a one time cost It makes sense to me that one vasectomy would cost less than 36 packs of birth control pills 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 01:12:52 2018|4|children can travel too 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 29 00:51:26 2018|23|nah I know plenty of people with kids who travel Just depends on finances and what kind of job OP wants to have 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 28 23:47:24 2018|24| Anyone else have those internal conflicts with what they want out of life Pretty much everyone Just find a balance you can live with 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 28 23:06:58 2018|82|It is definitely a hobby Especially what the people on that sub are discussing If it s a necessity which I don t think it is we can make do with a couple items from the drug store that will last at least a month even if we use it every day Spending extra money or not extra money in a lot of cases on expensive products is absolutely a choice and a hobby unless you literally work at a makeup store 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 28 22:58:12 2018|27|I m wondering Why did you go to a pediatrician In times like that go to the ER Pediatrics is not the right speciality for ovarian cysts 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 28 22:04:59 2018|29|Stalking is a form of harassment but not all harassment is stalking As to your former point that has no bearing on whether or not it is considered stalking 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 28 18:25:32 2018|24|That isn t stalking Perhaps harassment at work Though I doubt it but it s not stalking and pretty disrespectful to stalking victims tbh 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 28 00:00:19 2018|19|He can if he wants but that would be the end of our relationship so that s his choice 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 23:35:08 2018|23|I might be thinking of someone else but haven t you never had any kind of romantic intimate relationship with another human ever 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 21:31:47 2018|92|Nope too late now I d never sign something about a dog killing cats unless I knew the dog was loose and going into other peoples yards If those cats came into the dog s territory I m not sure why it should be held accountable for killing them It s an animal after all When my cat is outside I understand that it could be killed by any number of things and I wouldn t try to euthanize a dog or sue a person who hit him with their car either 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 21:27:25 2018|17|I have no demands of him and my request is that he treats me like a partner 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 16:18:33 2018|57|Someone begging for a boyfriend on instagram is very likely to attract men who prey on vulnerable women They get overly handsy and tend to argue with any no s because this is what you wanted etc There are plenty of good men out there but ones who respond to a plea on instagram are generally not 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 16:13:16 2018|4|Or date rape you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 16:09:34 2018|56|I d probably suggest to her that she stops begging for a boyfriend in Instagram because that will not turn out well Encourage her to get involved in activities where she will meet people and eventually she may find a boyfriend that way if that is her goal But she should try being happy single first 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 02:52:45 2018|76|It s just a bunch of privileged people who have no reason to complain about life creating some kind of reason that they can claim to be oppressed then going on tirades about people who have the gall to bring there children into a public space Does anyone else not want kids Yea a lot of people Sorry you re not unique or interesting because you decided you don t want little you s running around 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 02:47:01 2018|24|You clearly have very little going on in your own life if you re so preoccupied with your sister s choices Let her be 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 00:18:42 2018|28|I want to make a list of 15 things I m sick of hearing from childfree people who never stop talking about how they don t want kids 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 27 00:15:14 2018|40|I hope someone reads this story recognizes it and fires Scott if he is still working in the same facility He s trash and frankly so are you for telling it like it s something that s funny and okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 21:41:24 2018|21|I live in the US so the majority have been circumcised but I don t like it and I prefer natural 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 16:33:48 2018|38|You claim they used to have them and were discontinued so that pretty obviously points to the fact that there wasn t a demand for them If they were flying off the shelves they d keep producing them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 16:03:58 2018|88|Why are you here You asked why these tampons aren t made and people are giving you legitimate answers as to why companies have chosen not to make them and you re arguing But your arguments are so short sighted You need to look at the big picture You willing to pay a bit more for lubed tampons doesn t make it cost effective for a company to produce them It s not all about you The world doesn t revolve around your dry vagina I m sorry 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 16:01:28 2018|143|Companies don t care is a pretty simplistic way of looking at it As I said in another comment adding more cost effective chemicals to a tampon is just going to increase the chance of infection It s not a safe thing to do even if some people want it And some people is the key point Most people that experience that severity of vaginas dryness are not having periods or not having them heavy enough to need a tampon So it s not cost effective to produce them for the small amount of women that do need them My husband super loves Popeye s fried okra but here in the PNW it didn t appeal to many people so they discontinued it It didn t make sense for them as a company to supply a product that most people didn t want 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 15:45:29 2018|47|What I m saying is if you are bleeding enough to need a tampon over a panty liner the blood acts as a lube usually But either way it s probably just too impractical and too much of a liability for big tampon companies to do this 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 15:30:49 2018|40|Why can t you use a pad If you are bleeding so little that it doesn t make the tampon slip in more easily you can probably get by with panty liners tbh rather than having to stay at home 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 15:28:21 2018|37| a reason why they discontinued themMost likely 2 and 3 that she mentioned Coconut oil isn t super safe to put up in your vagina But I guess if you haven t gotten an infection yet whatever 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 15:09:07 2018|5|I like having visible eyebrows 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 15:07:49 2018|36|There is not likely a lube that is safe and will not be absorbed into the tampon If it actually hurt you I d suggest using a pad the first day or switching to a cup 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 04:57:49 2018|18|Also Sleater Kinney Save Ferris L7 the pixies tacocat trying to name ones that aren t already mentioned 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 04:27:24 2018|22|Rilo Kiley is her former band and they d have the most rock songs You might be familiar with Portions for Foxes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 04:10:31 2018|11|Congrats Fingers crossed that she stays away from him for good 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 04:02:14 2018|17|Anything involving Jenny Lewis is something I love though not all of it would be considered rock 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 01:55:29 2018|13|So her comments about misogynist personally offended you but you want fairness Interesting 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 00:44:12 2018|6|Maybe you had to be there 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 26 00:27:47 2018|8|Kinda weird to self identify as a misogynist 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 23:45:01 2018|155|There are buzzwords and phrases that people want to parrot to seem smart but most of the time they don t even use them right However regardless of how loose of a grasp they have on it they ll still fight to the death that they re right It s pointless No one admits they re wrong No one knows how to properly debate anymore If they are asked for sources they spin it that you are too lazy to google it They start bringing up additional things that weren t involved in the original argument and then tell you that you re only saying that because you don t have a response They argue that they only function based on logic while you use emotion when it s strikingly obvious from an outside observer that they are getting extremely emotional Just dumb all around Not limited to misogynists but they re a big offender 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 23:05:27 2018|16|Oh money laundering and emotional manipulation are ringing some warning bells Ya think Just leave him 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 18:53:15 2018|14|It would help if you explained here why you think your grade was wrong 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 18:30:36 2018|40|People get used to the pattern My MiL recently returned to her 40 year abuser after two years away thinking this time it would change Spoiler alert things were exactly the same the minute she stepped out of my car 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 18:09:45 2018|13|I did read your comment but this isn t a matter of opinion 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 18:04:18 2018|10|No seriously that s how the suggested stuff is chosen 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 17:57:20 2018|14|The suggested tab is based on what you have viewed liked and searched for 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 17:53:49 2018|46|You offer support and encourage them to get help Most EDs include obsessing over food telling someone to pay even more attention to it is the exact opposite of what you should be doing You re just ignorant and should stop making a fool of yourself 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 17:43:27 2018|18| she has an eating disorder dude You don t tell someone with an ED to watch your diet 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 17:42:39 2018|28|I have seen the opposite More body types ages and lifestyles have been accepted and lauded as beautiful They get more positive exposure since Instagram became a thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 17:27:35 2018|10|His apology sucked to Fuck him and Tambor and Cross 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 17:20:46 2018|4|It s clickbait nonsense 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 16:19:58 2018|10|Wow you just never stop peddling your bullshit website huh 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 16:10:59 2018|1|Okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 15:38:16 2018|23|They don t really see it that way obviously They tend to believe in their heart of hearts that they are doing good 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 04:52:58 2018|16|I d imagine he d say holy fuck you re the tallest person in the world 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 04:51:21 2018|57|Cool I m happy for you I never said it wasn t a thing I said I hadn t seen it It s incredibly rare and honestly neither here nor there when it comes to OP s situation Unless you too are arguing that she should carry the fetus further to term and give birth to it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 03:49:45 2018|39|You can say I m just going to look at books now Have a good one or something like that The majority of men aren t going to relentlessly follow you around the store after you clearly reject them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 03:20:37 2018|5|That s awesome And rare 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 00:56:50 2018|24|Oh well Live your life for yourself and not your mother She s not going to change her opinion any more than you are 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 25 00:08:13 2018|20|No your second paragraph was accurate no your first Those boys got killed as an unfortunate side effect of misogyny 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 23:54:07 2018|23|All of that is true but right after their death isn t the time to discuss with anyone why their children have died 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 23:47:30 2018|10|Cool That is uncharacteristically impressive and very rare Lucky you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 23:46:24 2018|6|Misogyny is responsible for their deaths 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 21:54:43 2018|4|They go into debt 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 21:33:26 2018|24|Right but she is going to abort it by paying out of pocket She s not going to be carrying it to 34 weeks 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 21:25:25 2018|48|I worked in OB for a number of years it averages out to about 3k out of pocket regardless of the insurance plan Adding onto that the emotional trauma of carrying an unviable fetus to term I don t know why this would be considered a good suggestion 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 21:23:12 2018|20|Where are you getting 34 weeks from The commenter said 25 and OP is currently less than 4 months along 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 21:18:10 2018|12|I ve yet to see an insurance that 100 covers childbirth costs 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 21:08:39 2018|44|Right It s not free plus She would still have the carry to fetus for a longer amount of time and then give birth to it knowing it s going to die anyway I don t see how this is considered an okay option 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 21:05:13 2018|17|Insurance only covers a portion of expenses They d still be thousands of dollars out of pocket 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 20:45:12 2018|10|Do you know how expensive childbirth in the US is 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 19:14:11 2018|46|It s her projected period That s not to say her period actually was going to start that day Like I said if she was ovulating that day she wouldn t be having a period the next day regardless of whether or not she was pregnant 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 19:10:35 2018|44|Yea if you were ovulating the day before the day your period was supposed to start it s definitely possible But even if you didn t get pregnant if you were ovulating that day you wouldn t have your period the next day anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 19:08:41 2018|1|Wow 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 18:59:31 2018|5|What good would that do 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 18:53:01 2018|25|A little weird to group all traditional medicine together like it s all the same thing Also are you just here to promote your blog 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 16:12:18 2018|40|I just wouldn t donate I don t think a church supporting a crisis pregnancy center is out of left field by any means If You like the care your kid is getting that s the most important factor imo 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 15:55:19 2018|38|I like messenger bags more than purses since they stay so secure but carrying things in my pockets just makes me look lumpy so I prefer to use a purse unless I m wearing something loose and flowy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 14:54:19 2018|25|All a colposcopy is is looking more closely at things Plenty of them don t end with any biopsies Chances are you ll be fine 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 14:06:33 2018|74|You should apply for insurance so that if you do need further treatment you won t be paying out of pocket for all of it after you hit the deductible I had a colposcopy and I don t remember it being very painful at all but I ve had a couple procedures and surgeries done in that area in the past so it could just be a comparative thing Plus everyone processes pain differently 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 03:13:17 2018|52|Yes he did say he wanted a simple girl who doesn t sleep around And she lied to him about being that instead of being honest with him It s her own fault for lying to him about who she was for two years He s not the asshole here she is 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 02:10:29 2018|21|He deleted all his comments but it still comes up when googling Stalidan peeping tom The internet is forever u stalidan
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 02:05:20 2018|69|No There are plenty of men who don t care and if it s something she is worried about she s can date one of those men Flipping it around to try and validate her choice to lie is just a testament to your own personality but somehow I don t think you d be so willing to forgive a guy who intentionally lied about something important to you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 01:46:37 2018|9|You didn t delete your comments in there smarty 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 24 00:06:51 2018|3|Sure ok bud 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 23:58:30 2018|9|you have an AMA about being a peeping tom 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 23:40:03 2018|12|It wasn t even an omission She straight up lied to him 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 23:39:33 2018|37|I d judge the hell out of an SO who straight up lied to me for two years regardless of the topic But especially if it was about something he she knew mattered a lot to me 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 23:37:09 2018|62| If he is willing to throw away 2 years of a good thing over the amount of ppl you had sex with shows he is sexist judgmental controlling immature and an A What if he is willing to throw away 2 years because his girlfriend straight up intentionally lied to him knowing the truth would have been a deal breaker all along 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 23:32:15 2018|65| How do you guys decide whether you should take time for yourself or be outgoing If I want to go out I go out If I want to stay in I stay in Maybe I m unique in this aspect though I doubt it but it s really not hard for me to figure out which I would prefer to do at any given time 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 14:36:26 2018|24|You do you but when someone supports politicians that literally sees certain people as less than human it tends to extend beyond just politics 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 03:05:45 2018|22|Yes people who are unable to wake up to an alarm would have difficulty doing that but that s not literally impossible 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 01:34:51 2018|44|Nah naturally they are just fine but they need their parents to instill the proper values that help them overcome the societal pressures that can mold them into rapists which generally don t exist for girls Girls have a whole other set of pressures 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 00:54:39 2018|45|No I am not low key doing anything I am outright saying that men are overwhelmingly more likely to rape even when it comes to other men So ensuring that they understand not to rape is essential for the well being of our future generations 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 23 00:39:08 2018|9|Start waking up at the same time every day 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 23:12:37 2018|63|I just listen and if it s a story they already told me I say something like oh yea I remember you ended up getting four apples instead right or whatever If it s some kind of education thing I usually just listen because everyone has a different way of relating information so I might learn something new amongst stuff I already know 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 22:04:35 2018|18|That tune would change quickly if your life depended on that pill Suddenly you find there is time 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 22:03:07 2018|2|I do 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 21:35:56 2018|52|There are plenty of men and women who are capable of taking pills every day on time They ll die if they don t There s that saying about being the company you keep The fact that you and your friends can t keep on a schedule is not likely a coincidence 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 21:22:46 2018|7|Yes it is a movement ideology etc 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 21:13:54 2018|24|There are perfectly good descriptions for it that aren t misleading like fertility rate not describing actual fertility Oh well doesn t really matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 20:59:03 2018|0| 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 20:49:10 2018|30|No making girls feel guilty for not accepting someone into their life will not be progress It will be the same old sexist shit dressed up with a different name 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 20:14:08 2018|74|If almost half are women that would make men and children the other more than half As children getting hit with stray bullets isn t a super common occurrence I doubt it would make a big dent in the percentage but it would likely mean that almost half or maybe half are men so about equal give or take a few Also children certainly aren t sexless but they are not men or women 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 18:54:16 2018|26|I am guessing the amount of men is about equal to women as children are also victims and they are not accounted for in this article 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 18:31:55 2018|68|Ill encourage women and girls to speak up for themselves and be assertive I ll encourage men and boys to respect their decisions and call out their buddies who don t Sitting silently and enduring the bullshit doesn t do anything to teach anyone that disregarding a no is unacceptable behavior It s funny you bring up Columbine since the idea that they were social outcasts was debunked 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 18:09:16 2018|63|This goes beyond this particular shooter It s not like this is the first time a woman has died for saying no Not by a long shot The idea that it is limited to this niche group of incels keeps pushing the issue to the back burner rather than more closely examining the epidemic problem of not peacefully taking no for an answer 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 18:04:51 2018|46|I ve been married for about 8 months and have been with my husband for six years altogether If it makes you feel better thinking I have some kind of difficulty finding and keeping a relationship that meets my standards I am sorry to disappoint you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 18:02:13 2018|25|I d rather people raised their boys to understand that women are allowed to say no to them and that they should respect their decisions 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 17:46:43 2018|19|Perhaps if he took no for an answer the first time there wouldn t have been any public humiliation 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 17:42:06 2018|33|Okay That just means about half are men Almost as if the population is somewhat evenly split amongst men and women so unfortunate chance occurrences happen to them in a roughly equal amount 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 17:25:34 2018|83|I think some of those reasons are pretty legitimate reasons to prefer having one over the other It s a lot easier to raise a little boy to know that no means no etc than to raise a little girl and just hope the parents of her peers taught their boys right But in the end parents tend to love their kids regardless of their preference for one gender over another so I don t see a big issue with having a preference 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 17:17:00 2018|7|That doesn t preclude what I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 16:56:27 2018|17|An edgelord who felt girls owed him a chance and became violent when he was denied it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 16:18:34 2018|38|I dunno that the Texas shooter identified as an incel or followed the movement He had a lot of the same ideology but I think it s important to acknowledge these toxic thoughts exist outside this niche group 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 14:56:31 2018|9| I ve even had the doctor check my thyroid
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 14:39:28 2018|26|Don t get me wrong I still plan on having a kid but I m not going to pretend like all that is sunshine and lollipops 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 13:25:02 2018|26|Meh without maternity leave and with the outrageous cost of childcare I wouldn t consider the US all too great for having a kid under 5 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 13:13:35 2018|39|Sorry you re sad and insecure but I m not and I won t encourage anyone else to be either No one should settle with a person who consistently upsets them just because they re afraid of being alone 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 13:11:39 2018|8|They d be around the 25 mark actually 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 13:10:53 2018|30|I mean there s no such thing as someone over valuing themselves I m exactly as valuable as I see myself and others opinions in it aren t really relevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 13:09:23 2018|18|You are misunderstanding I know what the term is referring to but I find it to be misleading 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 05:44:52 2018|108|I m against innocent people being dragged through the mud because they upset someone While the vast majority of rape claims that are brought to law enforcement are absolutely true this would bring about a new way to easily fuck up a person s life without taking any accountability for your accusations In turn it would just add fuel to the fire of the muh false rape accusations crowd and further delegitimize the plight of rape victims as a whole in the eyes of the public So yea I m going to be condescending Because it s a horrible fucking idea and shows extreme immaturity and short sightedness 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 05:34:02 2018|26|I dunno it was a pretty big thing with lots of discussion around it I don t think it s so out of line to ask 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 05:32:08 2018|9|I m sorry are you new to the internet 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 05:30:51 2018|9|Oh okay then go ahead and start it up 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 05:10:41 2018|37|If they aren t convicted there is absolutely no legal right to put them on a registry then Do you want a bunch of women being sued for libel Because that s all that will amount to 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 04:57:40 2018|18|I understand what the fertility rate is but it s not an accurate representation of what it describes 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 04:48:42 2018|54|I doubt they ll give two shits if you tell them you think it s inappropriate Plasma sperm egg donation are all somewhat easy ways to get extra money and college kids like that No one is forcing you to harvest your eggs so the best course of action is to get over it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 04:45:45 2018|25|Yea I never really understand why women choose to have a child with a person who has zero track record of being a capable adult 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 04:44:21 2018|10|Oh I really don t think that would end well 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 04:34:53 2018|74|It does but it doesn t Any statistic on fertility rate despite its name is about how many kids people are having not whether they re fertile or not There s absolutely no way to quantify the actual fertility of a country s people beyond their choice to reproduce or not and those who don t have either chosen not to or they can t but there isn t any accurate way of knowing 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 00:51:13 2018|18|I wonder why they refer to it as fertility rate when they re talking about the birth rate 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 22 00:08:29 2018|55|Long lasting relationships require comparability Which is why I have a long lasting relationship Because I waited for someone that I was compatible with Op and her boyfriend have different ideas of what is an okay amount of communication That s an incompatibility Not worth the effort they ve only been together a few months 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 23:48:11 2018|80|I find it pretty weird that you re so set in validating your opinion on whether you find something artistic enough to a bunch of strangers who didn t see the art anyway Your comments just sound like a long winded attempt to appear as though you re some kind of art critic If you are that s great but it doesn t change the fact that people enjoyed the art and purchased it so ultimately your criticism is irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 23:43:01 2018|18|It s a compatibility issue She s not getting the attention she wants She can get it elsewhere 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 23:20:19 2018|41|You are though If you weren t you would have spoken to him instead of running to the internet to complain But this is a stupid argument to have because you re not open to hearing other opinions So good luck 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 23:14:23 2018|35|I d argue you aren t ready for one if you re so desperate that willing to accept whatever treatment someone chooses to give you instead of finding a person who is compatible with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 23:10:07 2018|11|It doesn t really seem like you re open to help 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:55:58 2018|57|When someone is in the early stages of a relationship and has an extremely demanding job it is needy to expect them to forgo a relaxing fishing trip because you don t know what to do on a weekend without them I mean read her other replies she s co dependent Just calling a spade a spade 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:45:37 2018|14|Be single for a while and learn to like yourself as a single person 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:40:52 2018|43|So you think he should change his communication behavior because she s needy Plenty of people are understanding and completely fine with their SO having their own life and not catering to them She s not one of them so they re incompatible 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:28:26 2018|4|That s not healthy 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:23:07 2018|27|Don t put so much importance on being with someone then It s better to be single than be with a person you aren t compatible with 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:19:00 2018|33|No one is perfect You ve only been together for 7 months not nearly enough time be sure of compatibility Early enough to end it daily easily and find someone better for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:13:38 2018|42|If you re not getting the attention you want in your relationship find a new one Someone with very little free time is going to naturally want some alone time when he can get it No one is wrong here just incompatible 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:12:06 2018|28|Going on a fishing trip on a weekend means he doesn t value her Is he supposed to have all his free time revolve around her or what 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 22:03:28 2018|117| Because that s all it was Just photos of nudity To you that s all it was You can t possibly make the assertion that your opinion of all it was is the objectively correct one It s art Opinions on it are going to run the gauntlet no matter how simplistic you seem to think it may be Art is subjective but I guess I m here to explore the idea of when art is no longer art and just a bland attempt at aesthetic You can explore that all you want but you can t constructively do it if you can only consider your opinion to be the right one about this particular photo set 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 21:45:12 2018|68|So it was art that didn t particularly speak to you but other people liked it That s the nature of art My favorite painting by Salvador Dali is probably one of his most boring and plain paintings by most standards but I love it Art is subjective And If you didn t mind the nudity I don t know why you kept mentioning it in this post 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 21:19:52 2018|22|I don t see a problem with them being nude It s not like mermaids would have clothing if they did exist 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 21:07:19 2018|46|She probably assumes you d notify her with the results If someone tells me they re getting news on a certain day I don t bother them throughout the day asking about it I am under the impression they ll tell me when they re able 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 20:24:05 2018|10| not sure how that is relevant to what I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 14:06:53 2018|22|20 is legally an adult but the brain hasn t fully matured at that point so I understand why people are hesitant 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 14:02:23 2018|22|Yea and you can still get pertussis when you re up to date on your TDap but you should still get it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 05:26:13 2018|6|Read this user s post history 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 05:25:02 2018|8|Read her post history She s mentally ill 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 02:21:19 2018|1|No 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 01:07:50 2018|17|Oh then it totally makes sense that he killed 10 people Thank for clearing that one up 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 21 01:03:58 2018|8|I love the idea of raising a human 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 21:23:57 2018|15|Yea one singular female shooter in a sea of male shooters Way to cherry pick 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 20:28:44 2018|20|Because boys are taught that they re entitled to sex and get mad when they re don t get it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 17:05:28 2018|142| What I meant was that sometimes I want to have more sex after he finishes and sometimes I want to stop before he finishes it just depends on the time And the goes for him obviously both parties should be allowed to stop whenever that s kind of my point but what I m saying is that I as a female just innately feel wrong when I don t make it all about my male partner because of the way women are trained to focus on male pleasure during sex Someone being entitled to stop sex whenever they want is a human right Your personal guilt issues surrounding sex are irrelevant to that fact Your comments that imply he should have to keep going even if he doesn t want to keep going but stop when you say stop are very problematic 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 16:44:43 2018|4|So go ahead then 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 16:33:43 2018|34|Yep it is hypocritical to say he sucks He stopped before I got off And then turn around say you can stop sex whenever you want That s a right for both people involved 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 16:31:08 2018|8|Don t speak for women Speak for yourself 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 16:29:04 2018|26|I mean if your boyfriend isn t interested in both of you having an orgasm your boyfriend sucks and that s not an even playing field 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 15:56:24 2018|43|O don t think the pendulum needs to shift from it s all about men to make it all about women A nice even playing field is ideal unless you re into sub dom stuff Neither person should be encouraged to be selfish 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 15:50:51 2018|9|They haven t even had sex yet Slow down 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 20 04:51:33 2018|7|His house his rules Otherwise do whatever 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 18:27:02 2018|28|Why is she relevant here Y all seem a bit obsessed with her it s a little weird She isn t part of this conversation in any way 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 16:07:57 2018|70|You live in the Netherlands This article is pertaining to a significant problem that is currently getting a lot of attention here in the US and white women are big offenders in this issue so it needs to be addressed The fact that you don t agree with how and why it is being addressed to us specifically is kind of irrelevant since you live in an entirely different country 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 15:44:20 2018|24|Probably because white females were the people that called the cops on the Yale student and the family grilling in the park among others 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 15:43:03 2018|3|See a therapist 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 15:27:20 2018|111|You didn t say once during the entire exam that you weren t okay with what was happening And docs generally have someone else in the room for things like this exactly because of what you re saying If you really think she did something wrong the assistant would be able to corroborate your story or hers But judging by your description it was a normal doctor s visit you were uncomfortable because of your own personal issues and you didn t say anything It s totally within your rights to go to someone else but I ll warn you now that you will likely experience something very similar anywhere else 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 15:12:48 2018|1|Nope 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 14:23:53 2018|7|That s not for you to decide 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 14:20:46 2018|16|Indont know why y all bring up Hillary all the time Where did I mention her 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 05:00:05 2018|13|Nothing she said was condescending Calm down she gave you really good advice 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 19 02:32:47 2018|23|I d argue he s not a very loving father if he shows support for someone who treats women the way 45 does 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 21:57:50 2018|14|Hell of a way to word it if that s not what you meant 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 21:19:16 2018|59|Uh That s pretty fucked up to imply that it would be her fault if something happened She seems to have done a lot to help but no one is beholden to help someone indefinitely especially when they don t want help OP I m in an eerily similar situation and I can empathize PM me if you want 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 20:05:35 2018|10| Fungibilty n something that doesn t apply to this discussion 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 18:19:22 2018|16|What a weird picture Looks like the cover of the world s worst hip hop album 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 16:24:27 2018|95|I dunno who would tell you your boss is a creep and you should quit over it it sounds like he s just messing around and treating you like one of the guys It s maybe a little too casual for a professional environment but every workplace is a bit different It s kind of damned if you do damned if you don t if he treats you differently because you re a woman that s sexist in itself If he treats you the same as anyone else it makes you uncomfortable Which is better 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 14:00:52 2018|33|I don t think my dad is big on Trump but I wouldn t know Because he knows he gets to pick one Be a vocal Trump supporter or have a loving daughter

TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 13:23:10 2018|27|If they re black and that s how they feel who am i to say otherwise And disliking a group as a whole disliking the whole group 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 03:48:08 2018|7|Just going to keep reporting you now 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 03:41:53 2018|38| Its not victim blaming Yes it is Women aren t some mentally weak species Women aren t the only people that are abuse victims nor are women a species Abusive victims are are in a weakened emotional state 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 03:33:49 2018|52| Come on if they re staying what else is it It s abuse Abusers pick away at their victims until they think they have no worth deserve what is happening and don t think anyone else will want them Saying she s allowing herself to be abused is victim blaming bullshit language 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 03:24:24 2018|8| allowing yourself to be abused Ugh fuck that 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 01:57:10 2018|34|Like I said I m trained in self defense It s not likely to do anything to help me in a situation What do you suggest I m supposed to be doing beyond that 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 01:50:09 2018|43|He has always been like that though according to you He got better for a bit but it obviously wasn t important enough for it to stick There are plenty of good men out there Don t waste your time with an asshole 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 01:49:24 2018|139|My motivating factor for feeling safe is statistics I am statistically much more likely to get raped or attacked by my husband or someone I know And none of those people would rape or attack me So other than being aware of my surroundings when out and about there s not much else I can do If someone wants to attack me and rape me they probably will because despite being strong and trained in self defense I m not big enough to overpower most people If I carry pepperspray or a knife it s more likely that it will be used on me than for me to be able to use it on anyone so that s out of the question But I m not all that worried about these factors because it s unlikely to ever happen 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 01:24:32 2018|12|Do you want to spend the rest of your life like this 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 18 00:43:27 2018|51|This is valuable information Unfortunately many abuse victims won t believe it no matter how many times and ways they re told It s nice to make this known but they re the only ones that can ultimately remove themselves from the situation Hopefully someone who reads this makes that choice 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 23:15:19 2018|41|I think you re making it way more difficult than it has to be and you sound a bit high maintenance Just celebrate the weekend after or on your birthday or make it a joint thing There are tons of options 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 21:37:30 2018|21|I d imagine considering the question you d be able to suss out what race I am but I guess not 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 17:00:07 2018|11|Where did I say anything about being defined by her looks 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 16:59:11 2018|38|No she s using the term owner because she s a hypocrite who can t accept people making different life choices than she does but still finds it appropriate to criticize someone else for doing the same thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 16:55:36 2018|16|PSA you can vouch for women keeping their last name without the low key condescending bullshit 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 16:53:43 2018|18|No not for me The combo move is best followed by just clitoral stimulation followed by just penetration 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 16:46:44 2018|7| You can but most women can t 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 16:45:45 2018|3|Yea I can

TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 12:28:40 2018|34|Why is it shocking White people in America are responsible for the majority of tone deaf dumb and downright malicious shit that goes on and I don t like white people as a whole 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 04:58:22 2018|14| Also guys usually don t like cosmetic modifications We like it natural The irony 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 03:54:40 2018|17|Not all but in general women do prefer tall men Nothing wrong with it Everyone has preferences 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 03:35:04 2018|18|I don t really like white people as a whole so I feel more kinship with other women 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 03:33:46 2018|32|In general I d say women prefer men taller than them because they like to feel smaller and men like women shorter than them because they like to feel bigger and stronger 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 03:01:50 2018|34|All you were doing was insulting OP and his fianc e If you can t joke without being incredibly rude it s not other people who have a problem It s you Take care 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 00:49:05 2018|23|How is saying you re bummed that you ll be on your period during your wedding indicative of setting yourself up for failure 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu May 17 00:39:11 2018|30|Maybe don t be a dick I wouldn t be upset if my period started on my wedding day but I d be miserable if it was on Day 2

TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 16 21:12:12 2018|20|I mean you guys were in high school yea Considering you mention prom You haven t changed since high school

TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 16 16:42:53 2018|51|I dunno what to tell you dude I m not here to convince someone of the morality of abortion It is killing something Whether that is a baby or not is subjective and it s irrelevant if one believes in bodily autonomy But it ain t murder at least for now 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 16 14:20:38 2018|16|I didn t say anything about morality If abortion is legal it literally isn t murder 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 16 06:22:57 2018|15|You should see someone to help you work through your negative feelings toward your mother 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 16 06:09:26 2018|7|I d assume it was an accident 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 15 23:47:44 2018|12|Murder is the illegal killing of a person Abortion isn t illegal 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 15 23:44:23 2018|20|Is there ever a good time to break up with a person But I agree over text wasn t cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 15 23:41:23 2018|36|If you believe in bodily autonomy then you re pro choice It doesn t really matter when you think personhood begins if you think it s a woman s choice what to do with her body

TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 14:02:28 2018|29|I d rather you leave your own question to her than to hijack mine I don t need a refresher on what misogyny is I see it every day 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 13:58:36 2018|7|What are they supposed to be doing 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 11:46:50 2018|29|Except that there are a slowly growing amount of restaurants that have done it and this far in my experience it s the patrons that do the most complaining 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 11:45:09 2018|14|Yea I know that but we don t know what state she lives in 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 05:33:44 2018|10|Do you know where she lives Is it mentioned somewhere 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 04:59:52 2018|15|It certainly is Some cities are doing it more than others but gotta start somewhere 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 04:50:19 2018|55|I m sorry that happened to your sister but there is no polite or professional way to tell people they need to tip you It s not required and as much as it sucks no one is obligated to tip The manager actually did the right thing in this situation after his employee acted unprofessionally 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 02:15:30 2018|19|In a sexual role playing situation with a consenting partner the partner is consenting Are you really this dumb 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 02:14:28 2018|18|That s not for one person to decide on their own in a situation that involves two people 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 02:10:49 2018|14|Then the perpetrator is an idiot if they haven t established a safe word 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 01:17:37 2018|11|You re speaking in a hypothetical I have no experience with 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 01:02:33 2018|25|We have established that don t mess with one another when we are asleep so yes it would be sexual assault if he did that 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 00:50:13 2018|18|If they say no to sex and the person still has sex with them yes that is rape 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 00:48:58 2018|32|No that s exactly how consent works in my relationship I am a human being with agency mane I get to decide what is and isn t okay pertaining to my body 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon May 14 00:01:51 2018|76|I m pretty sure you re trolling but if not I m allowed to make whatever boundaries I want in my relationship with my husband He has my explicit consent until I revoke it not the other way around This is individual to each relationship and not a black and white thing It has to be discussed as the relationship progresses A stranger however does not have my explicit consent to do any of these things 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 13 22:39:18 2018|13|Oh my No I d be really weirded out if someone did this 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May 13 14:24:53 2018|16|Wow can t even wish people a Happy Mother s Day without throwing shade Grow up 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 12 17:40:00 2018|61|Who says they don t like her They re just closer to him and if an event is made for just close friends sometimes the SO isn t in the group I d never expect to have the exact same group of close friends as my SO We are different people with different personalities so we bond more with different people 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May 12 16:18:37 2018|49|He can t just invite you along to things where you aren t invited If they didn t invite you there is a reason for that Plus my ours in your 40s 50s Dating for a few months hardly qualifies something as a serious relationship in other peoples eyes

TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 11 23:19:02 2018|70|As I said as long as it was into the deltoid it s okay If it was into the bursa then it isn t If your arm was relaxed and she gave it at a 90 degree angle parallel ish to the floor it was probably fine and just sore If she gave it so high she couldn t put it at a 90 degree angle it was probably wrong 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 11 23:06:07 2018|17|Men B is a painful shot As long as it was in the deltoid it s okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 11 22:09:08 2018|59|I agree there should be some kind of assistance for cases like this but I don t think the law should be changed to allow people to throw out stillborn babies in the trash I have a feeling her choice wasn t based on cost of cremation but rather shock that she had just given birth But who knows 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 11 21:38:50 2018|22|I enjoyed Ghostbusters quite a bit and I like the actors in Ocean s Eight so I might check that one out 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 11 20:58:09 2018|34|Not sure I don t think she s fucked up either way though I m sure she had her reason to do it but that doesn t mean she didn t break the law 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri May 11 20:56:34 2018|28|I m certainly sympathetic toward her but it is against the law We can t really base whether or not to charge someone based on our personal opinions

TwoXChromosomes|Thu May  3 16:46:13 2018|79|All of this is totally true You re right When someone says iron though they are usually referring to hemoglobin as that is generally the first thing they check before deciding whether to run any further tests at least in the US Hemoglobin just gets checked with a little finger poke Then if it s questionable they do a full blood work up so it d be kinda random for her to specifically mention the serum over anything else

TwoXChromosomes|Thu May  3 11:15:44 2018|28|20 is an abnormally high level for hemoglobin and 15 is completely normal 12 is at the lower end of average normal and would not warrant any treatment

TwoXChromosomes|Wed May  2 15:18:23 2018|72|Depends on if the childcare costs more than your income If it does there really isn t any good argument from a monetary standpoint why you wouldn t just stay home til they re in school I d say the same if the husband was the one who earned less too If it s still more than childcare it just makes monetary sense to continue working Why doesn t he get that

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 21:50:38 2018|44|Eh people have different boundaries in their relationships and obviously she is okay with him interacting with other women She s asking for advice on how to get her confidence back not what she and her husband have decided is appropriate in their relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 21:42:32 2018|56|If you can t accept your new body you don t have to You can try different things and find out what works best for you to achieve something you re comfortable with It won t be overnight but there s no reason to just grin and bare it if you dislike your body that much 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 20:18:04 2018|41|Sometimes people who aren t very feminine looking are misgendered You could get a more feminine haircut or start wearing light makeup Is there a uniform at work that is particularly masculine or do you get to choose what you wear 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 18:53:17 2018|46|Sorry some people aren t that great You sound very angry If the weather is nice maybe go for a walk when they re getting to you I ve also found that yoga and meditation have helped me in not letting people like that faze me 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 16:45:36 2018|22|Yes that s it as my life doesn t revolve around validating a random opinion I shared on Reddit at 4am Sorry 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 16:09:15 2018|9|No we disagree on that Thanks for your time 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 15:35:55 2018|34|All skin colors are normal and the human construct of different races has caused much more harm than good Why would people choose to do the same thing to their completely normal sexual preferences 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 12:31:48 2018|41|I didn t say your feelings were invalid Anywhere It s great that you figured out what works best for you I guess I have to repeat myself The person asked why people think the term is bs and I answered 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 12:19:17 2018|28|I m not going to go through you questioning my stance on different terms The person asked why people think demosexuality is bs and I told her why 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 12:08:58 2018|30|Because the opposite is also normal Some people require emotional connection Some people don t Normal It s just another label boring people use to make themselves feel more interesting 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 11:53:31 2018|33|Therapy helps people understand their reasons for over eating I think you know that though and are just being a dick Gotta take any chance you get to insult a fat person right 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 11:45:40 2018|26|You ve only had it a week It takes up to six months for your body to adapt to it Go get checked by a doc 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 11:42:00 2018|17|Because that s called being a normal person and doesn t need a special word for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 05:58:47 2018|21|Wow dude This is definitely a case of a manipulative person finding the perfect victim I feel really bad for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 05:13:32 2018|41|Um I don t know if the issue is so much her being a sex worker but the fact that she became a sex worker secretly while in a supposedly monogamous relationship I wonder what else she s hiding from you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 05:11:04 2018|27|They probably didn t have much of a response because that was a weird thing to say Work friends of any gender are a super normal thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 04:46:49 2018|24|Mexico City is incredible You re very lucky I personally didn t have any issues the few times I ventured out alone while there 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 01:40:41 2018|13|That s assuming you ve been exposed to every single one of them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 01:09:32 2018|55|K I ll just report it again u BrunchFarts u SteveInskeep u parading goats u haute crimes u icecoldhotdog u SammySposa u armpit rash u Braided Bread u SemperFeminina u ill mace you u big ass cactus u boobs akimbo u Ciega sordomuda u nice try jan u killallben u lionsleepsalone u FoxMulderberry u Doxycyclist
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 01:06:26 2018|13|No there isn t Prepubescent and post menopausal women make up that 51 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 01:05:11 2018|34|You don t know that Let her get to that point before criticizing And stick to one username when replying It gets annoying having to respond to all your alts saying the same thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 01:03:16 2018|31|Little girls still look up to princesses as role models That isn t changing any time soon To have one that is a strong WOC is nothing but a good thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 01:00:35 2018|7|You realize not all women are menstruating 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 00:57:18 2018|29|Oh whatever Meghan is a WOC interested in women s rights who is about to become a frickin princess What better role model could she be at this point 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 00:59:53 2018|22|Where do you see the word forbade And frankly he s the boss he gets to decide hat happens at the workplace 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 21:27:55 2018|31|I hate trump and I dislike the people who support him a whole lot BUT i think the question was worded in a way to be intentionally misleading with its results 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 18:55:52 2018|33|Similar note I got caught in an I m good how are you loop with a patient Good morning How are you I m good How are you Good how are you Wait 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 18:38:05 2018|46|My coworker drums his fingers on the desk all the livelong day and it annoys the fuck out of me Other than that I have too many other more important things going on in my life than making a concerted effort to tally up minor discomfort 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 18:31:19 2018|44|If it was his first slip up I d agree But dude was addicted to opiates and keeps relapsing That s a terrible situation for children to be in and now they ve seen him almost die She should spare them from further trauma 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 16:43:47 2018|5|Her feelings aren t valid 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 16:19:32 2018|8|It s time to make plans to leave 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 15:54:19 2018|61|Honestly I don t think you even need to discuss it with her again What you said was completely right and she can either take it or leave it If she decides to move out she can let you know but otherwise just leave it at rest It s such a ridiculous complaint that it doesn t deserve any more attention 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 15:51:37 2018|47|The fuck they can think of her as a coworker They re in the comfort of their own home He can wear whatever he wants and if she doesn t like it she s free to move out They don t have to cater to her bs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 04:12:52 2018|53|Hey me either I don t move at all when I m asleep One time wi a previous partner though I apparently sat up and screamed at the top of my lungs before laying down silently Still don t remember it but it scared the shit out of him Sleep is weird sometimes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 03:43:01 2018|57|He sounds pretty rational and knows h can t hold something someone does in their sleep against them My partner is a sleep hitter kicker It doesn t happen often but I actually got a black eye once He is not a person that would ever do that awake so it s just something we deal with 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 03:16:43 2018|13|But why did it cause a UTI It wasn t in your urethra 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 02:51:56 2018|12|How would an iud cause a uti That doesn t make sense 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 18:20:40 2018|27|Yes it is a two way street He also doesn t have to engage in any sex acts just because he has done so in the past 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 18:14:52 2018|46|No one is beholden to continue participating in any sex act just because they have done it in the past If that means the end of a relationship so be it but she s not required to do anything just because she has done it before 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 16:29:12 2018|13|Yes though I would prefer for the draft to just be eliminated completely 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 16:15:15 2018|107|As I said any loose clothing I have has functional pockets I am not sure why you d argue with my personal experience My loose clothes have plenty of pocket space which is nice since I only wear loose stuff to walk my dogs and I don t want a purse for that Speaking of nonfunctional pockets my husband has lost his wallet twice with two different pairs of joggers because of it falling out I ve lost my wallet zero times Maybe I just know to confirm that I have it as I ve run the risk with tighter clothes of not having it stay put 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 16:12:23 2018|25|Yea definitely can depend on location I have lots of clothes and other than pajama pants my loose clothes allllll have pockets that fit plenty 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 15:43:36 2018|13|2 7 million viewers per woman vs 2 3 million viewers per man 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 15:27:17 2018|45|That doesn t have anything to do with what you said though You were trying to validate less viewership by implying that female speakers only talk about gendered things that interested fewer people But they actually have more viewers so that theory doesn t work 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 15:24:50 2018|98|I am generalizing since people come in all shapes and sizes but men aren t generally concerned about their silhouette and the hip area isn t usually the wider part on them anyway So a phone hitting against their hip isn t going to stick out in the same way it does on a woman As far as looser clothes not having pockets my experience is very different than yours as the only non functional pockets I ve experienced have been on form fitting clothing Every looser pant or skirt I have has pockets that work just fine 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 15:15:23 2018|11|They may not know Parrots need blood tests to sex them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 15:13:14 2018|26|But if you see a guy with skinny jeans and a cell phone in his pocket you can definitely see the entire outline of the phone 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 15:07:21 2018|37|Wow what a rude way to describe women who prefer certain clothing That s no better than if I said clothing with big pockets is for women who don t mind looking frumpy and butch Completely disrespectful 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 15:00:42 2018|36|Did you even read the article Female speakers get more average views per speaker So you re trying to validate why people aren t watching female speakers despite the fact that they ve got more views 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 14:57:07 2018|35|I think the OP choosing to omit the fact that there were 3x as many male speakers but they only have a bit more than 2x the views means there is an agenda being pushed 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 14:53:03 2018|32|There are 3x as many male speakers than female speakers and only a bit over 2x as many views for male speakers So that means proportionately female speakers have gotten more views 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 05:32:44 2018|13|Being introverted being timid and passive I m assertive and I get heard 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 00:39:43 2018|4|It s against Reddiquette 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 00:38:28 2018|13|You shouldn t be reposting things again and again regardless of the subject 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 00:33:18 2018|18|Probably because you spam dozens of subreddits with the same thing so you come off as a troll 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 00:30:34 2018|4|You already posted it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 00:14:19 2018|15|I know a lot of shitty people and only about half of them are men 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 23:41:59 2018|40|Unless you are regularly texting him stuff like this it was a really inappropriate reaction from him and way beyond just not knowing how to deal with hard stuff Hope you find the help you need and drop the dude 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 22:31:16 2018|122| Really How many anti choices have you met that are willing to have a real conversation Zero when things are presented in an accusatory manner like that And the same goes for pro choicers accused of murder An conversation where no one accuses the other of extreme things I ve had plenty Sorry I don t respect them as truthful They don t deal with factual data Some don t sure The loud ones mostly But a lot of them just don t like the idea of ending a life and there isn t any concrete fact on when life begins It depends on what someone qualifies as life And invalidating their opinion isn t a good way to open their minds 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 20:58:52 2018|15|Then y all are being incredibly stupid to not prevent the conception of a kid 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 20:45:52 2018|23|Honestly framing it that way is just as regressive as anti choicers calling us baby murderers It completely shuts down any possible conversation 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 15:36:49 2018|60|No they definitely have disdain for women who choose to abort and the people who support that choice It s not loving and compassionate phrases that are being shouted by protesters outside of abortion clinics Calling someone a murderer and telling them they re going to hell isn t something said to a person you don t have disdain for 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 15:22:51 2018|59|She s not really comparing anything Those are just two other things that are also dealbreakers for her But even if she was she d be comparing people who have a disdain for a certain group and want to restrict their rights to other people who have a disdain for a specific group and want to restrict their rights 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 15:17:55 2018|27|Some opposing beliefs absolutely warrant reexamining one s relationship If I found out my partner was vehemently against certain things I wouldn t hesitate to break up 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 14:58:36 2018|18|It protects against the majority of cancer causing HPV If you do your research you d know that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 13:03:43 2018|40|Yes they can but it s way more common for women and a large chunk of them caught it from a woman and wouldn t have grown yeast independently So it makes sense to consider it a feminine hygiene product 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 05:31:46 2018|7|Stand up comedians aren t overwhelmingly extroverted 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 05:29:46 2018|44|What medications and products would you qualify as masculine care Because they certainly have segregated sections for men s vs women s razors deodorant etc but there aren t many intimate products for men that would warrant an entire section of a drug store 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 05:06:20 2018|10|Yeast infection medication sounds pretty feminine care ish to me 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 05:04:23 2018|22|He s your husband s best friend not yours If he isn t being rude or cruel to you just drop it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 01:31:33 2018|30|And I don t approve of people issuing blanket apologies because they finally feel guilty about shitting on abusive victims when it ends up affecting them So here we are 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 01:16:51 2018|13|So then why are you complaining about women giving him perspective on it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 00:31:06 2018|41|He s got a guilty conscience and is trying to absolve himself from it by apologizing to a bunch of random women The fact remains that he gave zero fucks til it happened to him and he needs to examine that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 00:15:45 2018|22|He could have left out the part about how he doubted women until it happened to him F a bunch of that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 25 22:55:05 2018|20|So up until you could apply something directly to your own situation you thought millions of women were just lying 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 25 14:09:58 2018|35|His comfort with calling a woman a bitch numerous times for no concrete reason was pretty jarring It seems like all she did was give him his yearly review and neglect to mention his stroke 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 25 14:00:02 2018|21|It s downvoted because it isn t relevant to this sub That s the actual intended use of the downvote button 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 25 13:53:44 2018|24|I don t think this is relevant to this sub Maybe post on r offmychest or something Best of luck in the healing process 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 25 00:47:53 2018|12|Save the pseudo intellectual I m so logical bs for someone else 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 25 00:38:26 2018|37|She shouldn t be putting herself down but hey it s just cuz you re so attractive that men can t help themselves is so ridiculously tone deaf Sometimes it s better to just not say anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 25 00:35:07 2018|15|Being catcalled has very little to do with being attractive It s a power play 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 25 00:31:22 2018|23|That dude is whatever but it s worth mentioning that Prenups pertaining to earnings after marriage are not usually held up in court 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 23:41:52 2018|18|A lot of traditions were based on misogyny but that doesn t mean they still have to be 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 20:49:19 2018|9|Did you send the interviewer a thank you email 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 20:41:20 2018|11|Screen shot and send to university as well as the police 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 19:01:55 2018|39|I feel like posts like this are kind of ironic because you re making a post to bring attention to yourself and get pats on the back over something women experience Which is the exact thing you re critiquing 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 18:32:40 2018|37|I think your line of attack is better than going to the police I m not sure they d be able to do anything about it but you can definitely hit him where it hurts business wise 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 17:54:14 2018|26|That user would never send anything to mod mail because she s been suspended dozens of times under probably 2 3 dozen usernames if not more 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 17:51:39 2018|1|And 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 17:35:18 2018|40| Nobody talked about whether he would Other than that the word would is used consistently through the entire conversation He suggested he couldn t because he isn t gay No he suggested he wouldn t because he isn t gay 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 17:30:09 2018|35|No what he means is that he would have to be gay to have sex with another man He is not gay so he is not having sex with another man That is his boundary 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 17:22:45 2018|23|Obviously based on his boundaries he would Why are you trying to challenge that Are we only supposed to protect women s boundaries 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 17:18:50 2018|15|Just tell him you think it s immature and would like for him to stop 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 15:48:16 2018|37|I d consider it up to a point non verbal communication of what a person wants Obviously if he clutched the head and tries to force it into the penis that crosses a boundary at some point 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 15:45:57 2018|1|Sexxxy 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 15:32:32 2018|9|It would also render sexual activity passionless and robotic 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 05:52:34 2018|7|So you agree with me then Cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 04:37:59 2018|30|No I ve heard about her stealing jokes but the insults and vitriol thrown at her are still based on her appearance even if someone is upset about the jokes 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 24 00:29:17 2018|35|Creeped out is a stretch It was an innocent interaction but you felt uncomfortable with his hand on your shoulder which is fine But there was nothing inherently creepy about what he did or said 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 23:54:25 2018|19|No it s not what you re saying because what I said was in disagreement to what you said 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 23:35:51 2018|22|It doesn t really fit no because you still have the internet in that scenario which means the internet is a necessity 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 23:28:33 2018|41|Despite all the reasons people give for why they hate Amy Schumer 99 of the time their insults are based completely on her appearance Showing that there is no greater sin for a woman in the public eye than being unattractive 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 23:25:34 2018|13|Something isn t automatically a luxury jut because it hasn t always existed 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 22:46:33 2018|57|Why are you thinking she would only get them during boxing She goes there twice a week My guess is the other 5 days a week she isn t just sitting in a chair waiting to go to her next boxing class She s probably living her life and doing things and sometimes that results in bruises 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 22:44:16 2018|78|Sorry but From my perspective you re already meddling There s a million and one ways someone who easily bruised will get a bruise You don t know anything about her life at home right Then there s no reason to assume she s lying to you about something more nefarious If she s quiet and somewhat shy she s not going to tell you how out of line your questioning is but you probably made her uncomfortable 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 22:27:20 2018|2|Pretty safe 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 22:18:30 2018|14|The OP didn t mention that she had abused the kids in the past 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 22:10:42 2018|76|She probably gave you a vague answer because you re almost a stranger commenting unsolicited on her physical appearance I bruise easily too and if someone asks me where one came from I usually say I don t know and joke about being clumsy Frankly if someone I barely knew felt it was appropriate to comment on my bruises I don t know if I d be as easy going with my response as she was 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 21:08:11 2018|72|It sounds like he s putting his kids first above all else which means he s a good father Their mother is finally clean and can safely be in their lives and he s facilitating that in the only way that currently works for all of them What are your reasons for being uncomfortable with this Try and figure out specifically why it bothers you so much then discuss it with him 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 19:03:24 2018|27|Anyone in a new position is bound to need to prove themselves Just do the best you can and eventually he won t have anything to nitpick 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 16:29:41 2018|31|Losing weight doesn t automatically fix your self esteem so you re likely to still think you are in the league of less attractive desirable people regardless of how you look 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 16:11:55 2018|6|Hormonal sadness is still actual sadness 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 16:08:00 2018|5|Yea You should call CPS 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 13:21:30 2018|4|Current And past Yea 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 07:18:00 2018|41|Yup people like that have existed and had songs written about them for decades If I wasn t on my way to bed I d compile a short list of those songs to show this isn t anything new Maybe tomorrow 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 07:08:27 2018|24|You must be pretty young if you think anything she mentioned in her song is a new phenomenon It s a good song though 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 06:31:25 2018|8|What does that have to do with Instagram 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 05:05:11 2018|17|Oh my gosh I m so sorry That is awful Honestly the only real cure is time 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 04:26:21 2018|9|Yea just stay away from those kinds of parties 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 04:12:07 2018|33|Sexual assault rates are really bad because there s a lot of excessive drinking so I think the best plan would be not to drink excessively and stay away from people who do 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 04:10:47 2018|12|It depends on the relationship s boundaries but generally yes it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 03:02:11 2018|11|Get as far away as I can and call the police 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 18:51:28 2018|14|Why doesn t she just drop her shitty friend and call it a day 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 15:44:05 2018|36|The main reason given was that the mayor didn t want to use tax dollars on that for any group and a councilman stated only 10 of the students had signed anything in favor of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 15:40:01 2018|61|Looks like only 20 250 students in the school signed anything to say they were in favor of the crosswalk But they have another chance to get more support If the majority of the kids don t want it why would a petition by a bunch of strangers who have never been and never will be there take precedent over them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 15:36:23 2018|22|He also said he d deny it if the church asked for a special crosswalk too Why d you leave that out 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 15:29:02 2018|14|No you also posted a bunch of comments which you deleted after posting this 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 15:24:25 2018|4| that s not true 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 15:23:33 2018|44|Was the woman who signed the prenup illiterate Then I totally agree But she probably wasn t And no a prenup that says anything about alimony in the case of divorce generally gets that part thrown out in court Prenup covers pre marriage assets 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 06:37:24 2018|13| no it wouldn t Unless the child was born pre marriage I guess 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 06:35:38 2018|18|They exist You just aren t one Probably should have deleted your old posts before making this one 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 06:19:10 2018|8|You re a conservative in favor of communism

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 05:08:12 2018|22|I asked who would care enough to change your mind You can hate this sub all you want Why does it matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 04:59:02 2018|21|Why would anyone care enough to try and change your mind If you don t like it don t read it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 23:38:18 2018|10|No she isn t pregnant Don t waste your money 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 22:17:29 2018|108|I agree with you 100 And I personally don t talk about my exes like that nor does anyone I know The black and white thinking that seems to be getting emboldened even more each day will paint someone as either a horrible person or a wonderful person when 99 of people are somewhere in between My exes and I didn t work out because we found some fundamental incompatibilities That doesn t mean either of us were wrong or evil Relationships are just tough and you see the best and worst of a person I never understood putting the blame solely on one person when it fails 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 22:10:45 2018|29|That is weird but I think part of it has to do with the fact that they generally don t do anything pertaining to the clitoris during an exam 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 22:01:00 2018|6| that s not how things work 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 21:55:05 2018|25|That doesn t make any sense nor does it answer what I asked Try again Or don t You re already talking out your behind 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 21:41:35 2018|47|But in context your response was pertaining to women getting the right to vote and the fact that it was men who granted that power So are you saying women had the agency to get the right to vote independent of men allowing it If so how 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 21:02:41 2018|13|A physical majority doesn t automatically put someone at the top of society 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 21:01:04 2018|18|I don t think shutting the fuck up and never sharing their feelings is a very basic concession 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 20:32:52 2018|35|Why would men support feminism if all it entails is women like you telling them to keep their seat and shut the fuck up Who d support something that is meeting them with open hostility 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 20:31:13 2018|111|You said most marriages fail Pretty much every source I ve seen confirms around 40 50 I provided you with sources that said those statistics are inaccurate and yes despite your cherry picking of one sentence in the entire 4 5 paragraph explanation on divorce com it does explain that the statistic isn t very accurate and actually pretty hard to calculate for many reasons But even if you do take 40 as absolute gospel that isn t most which is the word you used Especially it is declining not rising Sorry bud a lot of the stuff you say on this sub is spot on but you re wrong here 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 20:14:25 2018|122| fuck off no it s not It actually is Feminism is about equality and we can acknowledge the instances where men get the shit end of the stick The main issue with men in feminism is the whataboutism of a lot of men which tries to invalidate women s struggles in order to bolster attention towards men s struggles But that doesn t mean men can t respectfully be included in a conversation and have their inequalities recognized too There s just a time and place for it and it can absolutely be included within the discussion of feminism Especially since a lot of the issues men face are because of the patriarchy which is exactly what feminism is trying to critique 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 20:07:58 2018|44| Why is the assumption male breadwinner male control of finances Because that s generally the way things have gone for decades There are exceptions as you mention you are one and things are slowly shifting but that is still overwhelmingly more common than not 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 19:59:21 2018|18|This one has a link to a good NYT article about it so I won t post both 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 19:04:41 2018|27|Maybe know how to actually interpret statistics and understand that the divorce rate is 50 and other such facts are just used to enforce certain groups narratives 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 18:47:27 2018|82|I think people should do whatever works best for them but anecdotally through my own and others experience having our own separate accounts plus one joint account has been the best way to go The joint account is used for very specific things and no one uses it without discussing it first Separate accounts can be used however we want My partner makes about double what I make and we put the same amount into the account It works out very well 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 18:43:09 2018|11|A joint account isn t really the issue in that situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 18:36:58 2018|25|Nope the whole point of feminism is inclusion and equality Excluding almost half the population because of their gender is the exact opposite of feminism 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 21 00:06:13 2018|7|Was this meant as a comment reply 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 23:56:56 2018|52|But if everyone deserves to be loved and treated with respect why don t you tell men that Because you re putting women on a pedestal and trying to make yourself feel better about being a shit You re using random women online as pawns to make yourself feel better Save it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 23:19:18 2018|16|If that s the case then make the same post on a subreddit for men too 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 23:06:04 2018|57|This post isn t really beneficial to anyone but yourself Like women are all different people Making sweeping generalizations and comments about what we do or do not deserve and how we should or shouldn t be treated kind of really misses the mark on your claims that you have this newfound respect for half the population 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 22:52:58 2018|17|Okay then I m just wondering why you felt the need to post this here I guess 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 22:52:15 2018|6|Those are her mistakes to make 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 22:46:45 2018|16|Apologize directly to the women you have hurt and treat people with respect from now on

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 20:39:10 2018|18|You re asking the logic behind weight and height being two different things They measure two different things 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 19:55:27 2018|25|I don t know if you knew this but height and weight are two different things Asking a woman s height is also socially acceptable 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 19:04:39 2018|22|Same here Plus I try to keep healthy snacks in the house so at least I m not binging on total garbage

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 15:20:36 2018|56|I m arguing that he came out of prison and continued doing the same shit abusing his romantic partners that landed him there If prison didn t rehabilitate him living in society and not being held in any way accountable for his abusive nature sure as shit wouldn t I m done discussing this with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 15:09:47 2018|22|In what way does severely emotionally abusing a woman after release point to him being rehabilitated and an acceptable member of society 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 15:06:40 2018|31|Nah I d say the majority of people who flirt with a taken dude are doing it because there s little risk of them wanting to make them their wife gf 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 14:40:10 2018|94|I m not going on what OP said I m going on what I read He claimed he slapped her four times but all signs point to her being hit more than that and he did beat her to death He beat her and she died And he showed so little remorse or caring for that horrific incident that he psychologically tortured another woman upon release If that doesn t fit your personal description of a piece of human garbage who shouldn t see the light of day I dunno what to tell you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 14:09:26 2018|44|My partner and I know the boundaries in our own relationship It s not anyone else s job to police those If a woman is crossing a boundary it s on him to stop it not on her to know what our boundaries are 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 13:58:30 2018|36|Not everyone considers it making a fool out of anyone Everyone has different ideas and boundaries when it comes to that I m sure the majority wouldn t of most women were insecure in their relationships

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 05:47:44 2018|37|He s right you do need mental help You re an abuser and no one here can tell you why you have traveled down that path but a professional can work with you to figure it out 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 05:39:25 2018|38|Do self work and communicate with your boyfriend But don t tell him you think he should end his friendship with her And yes telling him he needs to end a friendship because you are insecure is unfair 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 20 05:29:17 2018|61|You don t have to like all your boyfriend s friends and he doesn t have to end or distance friendships just because you mutually dislike a person If you trust him it shouldn t be an issue But it sounds like you re insecure in your relationship and don t trust him So either fix the relationship or end it

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 19 15:27:11 2018|123|Some medications have been taken long enough by people that they have concluded without specific trials that they re probably safe for pregnant women Obviously not a solidly proven as if there were clinical trials but they have a good idea Beyond just affecting the fetus certain things that happen during many pregnancy could be affected more when taking certain medications And they definitely know of some medicines that increase the risk of birth defects At any rate I m still not sure why you d conclude from my first statement that they d just send someone away if they re pregnant Especially with abdominal issues sometimes the cause can be pregnancy so it would be really ridiculous not to test for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 19 15:15:50 2018|13|Uhm No they would just give them options that are safe for pregnancy

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 18 22:31:37 2018|58|Uh why don t you believe what was said to him He s telling you that s what they said to him Why would your friend know what his experience was and why would you err on the side of believing her over him Just because she didn t hear it doesn t mean it didn t happen

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 18 04:50:35 2018|131| So it s perfectly okay if I consider it to be terrifyingly violating but others don t so it s not a bad thing Well no that s not the point The point is that generally you don t get to change the definitions of words If you find it terrifyingly violating that isn t the norm and I hope you get help with that But regardless of how you feel about it it isn t rape no matter how often you repeat that word You are certainly not the only person that feels violated by it but you are in the minority not the majority And your feelings about it are quite severe so you re going to have a hard time finding someone to agree with you about this

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 17 17:45:57 2018|37|It shouldn t play a factor either way The best person for that particular role should be the first person on Mars Man woman black woman trans man whatever Identity should not play into the decision whatsoever

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 15 17:12:27 2018|177| Yes sorry if the original post wasn t clear but I broke up with my most recent partner because he said he didn t want to use a condom even after contracting an STI But up until that point you willingly had condomless sex with him no I guess it s just an issue because even when I talk to men about this even before we ve had sex they act like I m being unreasonable or uptight So then don t have sex with those men I don t want to be viewed like that I want to be a fun and accommodating partner So you want to be a doormat who is open to STIs so that more guys like you Please find a good therapist This is toxic thinking I ve even met several guys who say they don t need to use a condom or be tested because all of their previous partners were clean And you are equally as much to blame if you believe them and have sex with those dummies 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 15 16:53:49 2018|36|It s a two way street You re still choosing to have sex with them after they refuse to use condoms Stop that If they really want to have sex with you they ll use one

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 15 05:24:00 2018|29|Reflexively and nonchalantly drinking from an ex boyfriend s cup in front of his girlfriend can be a bit too familiar for comfort and rub someone the wrong way

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 15 05:10:43 2018|43|A 7 month relationship isn t new It s not old but if you re with someone for 7 months it generally means you like them enough to consider a future with them So eventually they would override any previous friendships within reason 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 15 05:08:41 2018|45|You keep trying to defend your actions We get that you don t think it was a big deal but clearly she did So if you want to continue with your friendship think a bit more about your actions and how others may interpret them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 15 05:00:44 2018|42|Why can t you accept that your actions could be seen as inappropriate to some people I m not a jealous or insecure girlfriend but if my dude s ex started drinking out of his cup she d get hella side eyed

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 15 00:47:17 2018|19|It s related to the patriarchy toxic masculinity so it is related to feminism and relevant to the sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 15 00:29:04 2018|25|Actually a lot of people are giving advice about if she does smell but are also acknowledging that her coworkers might jus be assholes too 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 17:01:43 2018|28|No girl you underestimate how assholish people can be Is their way of making fun of your weight without getting in trouble for making fun of your weight 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 16:50:03 2018|29|I really think it s a passive aggressive jab at the fact that she s fat To me it is somehow worse than just making fun of her weight 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 16:20:45 2018|23|My love for kids has steadily increased starting at age 26 ish I m in my 30s now and I absolutely love them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 16:09:10 2018|58|Really just sounds like those two women are being assholes You should ask your boss to talk to them If it was a real problem I m sure they would have approached the boss about it The fact that they keep it amongst themselves but are vocal enough that you hear it points to them just being jerks 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 15:12:08 2018|6|I ve read the subreddit before 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 15:02:09 2018|23|You re on Reddit Hating children is like one of the most common circlejerks Go over to r childfree They thrive on it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 14:12:25 2018|33|It s disingenuous to tell people they will have the same reaction to birth control as you do Everyone is different and what didn t work for you might work fine for them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 05:10:45 2018|19|Walking toward a person on public property isn t generally an acceptable reason to pull a gun on someone 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 05:07:26 2018|22| Bi is just as indirect as gay and straight And maybe even moreso since it can describe either sexuality or romantic inclination 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 04:57:47 2018|36|Not to be rude but what good would a gun have done in this situation The guy looked at you and approached your car We re you planning on drawing a gun on him for that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 04:09:16 2018|15|Straight people are hetero sexual Gay people are homo sexual Bi people are bi sexual 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 03:05:29 2018|35|Good for you You have to wonder what kind of life someone like that has Must be a pretty bad one if he s got nothing better to do than torment people online Stay strong 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 01:32:01 2018|7|Never heard of this Can you elaborate 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 14 00:55:07 2018|19|No she said she s a stay at home mom and a feminist Neither of which are mental illnesses 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 23:39:27 2018|12|Your post of this exact thing was already removed Why post again 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 20:39:48 2018|47|The only comment that was removed was something inane like write down his license plate number and then accuse him of looking at kids on the playground Removed comments still show up on the total comment count If there were loads of removed comments we d know 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 19:31:29 2018|13|It does but literally none of the posts are blaming her for anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 19:14:39 2018|4|Who is blaming her 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 17:31:30 2018|24|He just used the lowest hanging fruit I ve never seen an account of road rage where the insults were well thought out zingers 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 17:12:15 2018|6|Road rage ain t no joke 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 17:00:26 2018|13|Did you cut him off or something Why was he mad at you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 16:19:56 2018|54|That s why I stopped being vegan They can test for a DNA marker that is present in 98 or so of celiacs If you have it they often then make you eat gluten every day for two weeks and then do an endoscopy to see if the cilia in the intestines are damaged 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 11:31:59 2018|9|Condoms can slip especially when drunk people are involved 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 03:44:52 2018|13|You re older than her so start acting like it and grow up 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 02:38:17 2018|5|You can make your own 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 13 01:16:07 2018|11|It can be depending on how it has affected your body 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 23:42:04 2018|165|That s a tough one because everyone has a different place to draw the line Like I have Celiac Disease and psoriasis and other than when the CD was undiagnosed I don t feel like either has had a hugely negative effect on my quality of life so I don t think it plays into my decision whether or not to have kids My grandma was schizophrenic and that s hereditary too I wouldn t want my kid to have to deal with it But it s a crapshoot and my perspective is that since we know it s in the family we know what to look out for Plus I have a strong suspicion she actually just suffered from severe untreated PPD after losing a baby in childbirth So basically you just have to decide with your partner where your line is There are a lot of tests now to find out how likely it is for your fetus to have different disorders too 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 23:20:02 2018|14|I don t think it has anything to do w business as I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 22:58:12 2018|19|I addressed this further downthread and I think it s an important factor yea but adds into the sexism 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 22:56:49 2018|35|I think it s both things and a lot in between too Like I said in another comment it s a bit hard to simplify it down into a single problem with a single solution 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 22:55:24 2018|40|I am not making the choice of encouraging women to stay out of dangerous situations while encouraging men to enter them no It s ingrained in society and as I said there is no quick or easy fix to that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 18:52:36 2018|137|I do think it is sexism but I think what you said absolutely plays into it It the end both men and women are at different disadvantages for different reasons Women make less money at a variety of things not just Uber while men end up putting themselves in situations where they are statistically more likely to be in physical danger It s implements from a very young age that women are smaller weaker and need to take more care of where and how they travel while men don t get that kind of conditioning So men are more likely to go into those situations thinking they re safe and statistically they re more likely to be the victims of a random attack It s lose lose really But personally I d prefer making less money overall 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 18:39:02 2018|59|I feel like you must have misunderstood what I said I m sorry if I wasn t clear and you think I dismissed the study but I have said twice that I think it s legit so I not sure what else you re expecting me to do and frankly I don t care enough to do it anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 18:15:18 2018|28|I didn t dismiss the study at all I don t think there s any reason to believe Uber is a sexist company based on what was found 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 17:36:06 2018|29|So you and white dude approached a black guy and urged him to hire for diversity Gee I can t imagine why that wouldn t go over well s
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 17:33:05 2018|8|I don t agree with you either though 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 17:32:46 2018|36|Really though It s rare that a conversation becomes heated without input from both sides If one or the other just abandons it it doesn t become heated but it seems neither of them did that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 17:09:49 2018|7|Probably since we are two different people 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 16:47:47 2018|30|She heard through the grapevine after being fired that they wouldn t interview one particular woman That s hardly a case for claiming they won t interview women or minorities 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 16:46:00 2018|9|I don t think there is an easy fix 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 16:43:26 2018|39|Sure if it s done right I think too many authors and screen writers fail at writing realistic women beyond two specific tropes and I d rather just not have more woman characters at all if that trend continues 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 16:41:33 2018|19|Yes and the way to make them realize it is to get into a heated argument about diversity hires 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 16:33:29 2018|21|You re right She didn t tell him to make a diversity hire She urged him to make a diversity hire 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 16:26:06 2018|49|So Uber isn t paying them differently and Uber isn t the problem but I think it brings on a bigger conversation Wouldn t the fact that women tend to feel the need to choose safer routes and times of day play into the bigger roles of institutionalized sexism 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 16:23:22 2018|9|Wonderful question for a medical professional and not Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 16:20:34 2018|64|If he felt as though he was in some way oppressed in his position sure But just having a bunch of white dudes in a position doesn t say that And the fact that she was pushing for a random woman POC hire could imply to him that she felt he was a diversity hire and would understand Just really poor form and unprofessional 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 15:44:57 2018|29|I mean I m all for diversity in the workplace but telling a black guy they need to make a diversity hire is a pretty ridiculous thing to do 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 15:26:51 2018|10|Not exactly Periods without ovulation are a thing that happens 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 04:04:23 2018|38|I think you need to take time to grieve before you start making plans of what to tell the next woman you see When the time is right you ll know what to do Sorry for your loss 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 03:42:05 2018|3|Need more details 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 03:40:42 2018|21|So you were just looking for people to agree with you completely and not call you out on your controlling behavior 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 03:39:32 2018|5|Is she going completely alone 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 03:07:42 2018|6|Nope you don t trust her 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 12 00:47:53 2018|21|Yea a white MRA on Reddit probably doesn t live in a western country you re right what was I thinking 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 23:53:18 2018|17|Ever think you hear most of the complaining in the West because you live in the West 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 23:40:30 2018|143| I m not going to pretend to be knowledgeable about such problems in these countries but it s not about that No that s exactly what it s about You made the blanket statement that we don t need feminism anymore based on your own life instead of taking into consideration the millions of women who live in countries where they are still getting their rights denied due to being women Why focus on only one gender Because there are people in this world who are still at a gigantic disadvantage because of their gender and deserve to have that kind of atrocity recognized If so then the focus should be on humanity as a whole not the problems one gender or the other faces We can t focus on humanity as a whole until people are on at least marginally equal ground 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 22:33:47 2018|1|Do
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 22:19:04 2018|65|If that s what you think why did you say it was very necessary for a time and the time has passed There are still women suffering all over the world from the things that thankfully have been solved in the US etc Why is it suddenly not necessary for them Why is humanism magically enough for those women now but not in the past 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 22:05:50 2018|29|Maybe in your neck of the woods but there are a lot of places where feminism is absolutely still needed desperately so blanket statements like that aren t helpful 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 22:01:37 2018|23|Similar to the difference between egalitarianism and feminism it assumes humans as equals rather than focusing on the disadvantages of a specific group 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 18:54:28 2018|2|Mass hysteria 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 18:09:47 2018|21| I am not sure if you re being deliberately obtuse or if my point just went really far over your head 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 16:38:23 2018|15|Why don t you communicate that to him instead of writing an open letter online 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 16:26:18 2018|5|Some do Some don t 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 16:25:19 2018|16|Lucky And the pull out method isn t entirely ineffective especially combined with the rhythm method 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 16:22:28 2018|12|The funny thing is y all agreed from the very first comments 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 16:19:41 2018|17|If humans feed it to them Cats don t go around sucking cow udders in the wild 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 15:47:50 2018|51|They ve literally said that it s all discrimination and if it goes then men s clubs too should go And you re also saying it s all discrimination and it all should go Like that is the conversation that is being had but somehow it s an argument because Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 15:28:16 2018|18|Them The sky is blue You THE SKY IS A PRIMARY COLOR THAT IS NOT RED OR YELLOW 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 15:12:56 2018|18|I feel like you think they re arguing with you but you re both saying the same thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 14:01:40 2018|12|Regardless of how much xyz only things are needed they are discriminatory 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 13:32:28 2018|13|Wow what a revelation And also water is wet and salt is salty 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 06:12:26 2018|66|Like I said I hope you don t claim to be pro choice what with the idea that the government should have control over our reproductive organs You sound like a really pleasant person It must be a real challenge to turn down all the people that I m sure are begging you to have their children in hopes that you pass down your glowing personality 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 06:02:06 2018|28|Yes I m the one that sounds bitter in this Not the person cursing up a storm name calling and advocating for governmental control of our reproductive organs 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 05:58:35 2018|13|You must have made a wrong turn somewhere This isn t r askmindreaders
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 05:54:39 2018|19|I d say thinking there should be governmental control over how many children people can have fits that description 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 05:53:10 2018|1|Yep 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 05:52:52 2018|2|Ask them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 05:52:11 2018|10|I m just grousing about a common Reddit circle jerk 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 05:47:40 2018|16|Go over to r childfree They are appreciative of this pseudo intellectual bemoaning of faux oppression 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 05:42:58 2018|82|She made a very simple statement and you are putting all sorts of weight on it without even asking her what she meant She s 5 Not everything a 5 year old says has some kind of deeper meaning Impact her by being supportive of her endeavors as I said She s your niece not your daughter You aren t the one raising her but you can at least be an open guide if she comes to you for help or advice 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 05:28:21 2018|48|While I think you re right to encourage your niece to try things I feel like you re putting a very adult perspective on an innocent comment made by a child Just be supportive as she decides what she does and doesn t want to do in life 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr 11 00:41:53 2018|28|Someone hitting on me because they find me attractive not shallow Me not wanting someone I don t find attractive to continue hitting on me shallow Got it

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 10 16:49:17 2018|9|How you handle something doesn t negate its racism 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 10 16:27:49 2018|36|I am married to one and the amount of racism I hear pertaining to him pales in comparison to what he himself hears on a daily basis I m not sure what utopia you live in 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 10 15:54:43 2018|29|Even if coastal cities there is still rampant racism against Asians I mean I live in Seattle which is like Asian American central and definitely it s a thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 10 15:42:59 2018|36|Tell that to an Asian man There is still a ridiculous amount of casual and not so casual racism toward Asians men in particular that would never be acceptable if it was about any other race 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 10 11:10:48 2018|15|Makes sense I was confused why they used inches at the place I shopped tbh

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 21:58:33 2018|9|He doesn t have knowledge on having an abortion 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 21:26:36 2018|26|You are getting bad reactions because you are invalidating women s experiences and giving suggestions where none were asked about things you ve no knowledge about 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 21:06:49 2018|29|They are adult human beings with personal authority It s their choice It may have been heavily influenced by their upbringing but they ve still chosen to do it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 20:57:09 2018|34|It s literally impossible to not have any influence on your children As far as the rest of what you said goes I m having trouble understanding how it relates to what I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 20:38:25 2018|13|What s not fair Everyone is influenced in some way by their upbringing 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 19:06:09 2018|54|What s the rush Sounds like you re already living as married yea But everyone has different priorities If you truly think it s better to abandon your mostly happy relationship with the hopes that you ll find someone better who also has the same timeline exact timeline as you that s your prerogative 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 19:00:27 2018|14|The deal is that s what they ve chosen to do with their lives 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 18:54:07 2018|8|Why are you assuming she has frequent abortions 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 18:24:32 2018|10|Congrats to her I m surprised she was the first 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 18:12:08 2018|71|I honestly don t think you do get where I am coming from because you seem like you re unable to wrap your head around the concept that there is a difference between being at a point where it can survive outside the womb with the care of anyone vs only being able to survive by being sustained by a host who can t pass the care off to someone else 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 17:17:43 2018|5|Why isn t it ok 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 17:18:24 2018|4|You aren t everyone

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 17:22:46 2018|36|You re defending the comment that it s Rarely sad for people by saying it wasn t sad for you The fact that it wasn t sad for you doesn t mean being sad is rare

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 17:44:07 2018|25|At that stage of development it all depends on how she feels about it and what the woman has intended to do about the pregnancy 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 17:49:21 2018|27|A baby born is able to be kept alive by anyone The onus doesn t directly lie on a person to sustain it within her own body 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 16:41:29 2018|4|It s not what 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 16:00:11 2018|39|Because it is a situation where there is a lot of societal pressure to have some kind of deep emotional reaction so writing about not feeling that way helps other people know their feelings or lack thereof are normal 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 15:54:32 2018|16|If they don t consider it a child then why would they be sad about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 15:50:58 2018|12|Hey not everyone is going to feel the same emotions about things 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 15:28:10 2018|7|She s looking for support not suggestions 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 15:24:35 2018|16|Because you have no relevant input on another person s medical decisions It s her choice 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 15:23:04 2018|26|You don t get to have thoughts on what a woman chooses to do with her body Or you can have them but they re irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 15:16:23 2018|9|Getting an abortion is taking responsibility for the situation

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 06:37:37 2018|37|Fill a sock with rice and wrap it in a wet paper towel and heat it in the microwave That way the heat will slowly wear off and you can doze off without being too consistently hot 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 06:34:06 2018|54|Often times I don t have a very busy job so it s a good time waster And sometimes the conversations I read or participate in are genuinely thought provoking I tend to have pretty moderate views on a lot of things so offering those opinions in the land of extremism is nice too

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 01:06:27 2018|42|Little kids don t have filters If they see a very fat person they usually will just say that the person is very fat They re not judging they don t have that capability yet They re just saying what they see 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 01:00:10 2018|31|Male circumcision started for religious reasons and then they made up some half truths to try and make it seem like a medical thing to legitimize it amongst the non religious 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 00:56:55 2018|16| FGM is usually done to control women s sexuality that s why mgm first began too 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 00:54:55 2018|15|It s just a good arguing point as to the downsides of circumcision is all 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 00:30:34 2018|39| The vast majority of boys who get circumcised are content to be circumcised and not victims They didn t have a choice If they wouldn t have chosen to do it for themselves they did not consent to it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 00:26:39 2018|13|So you re going to reply to literally nothing I said Got it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 00:16:48 2018|66| If it s so bad then why has it literally been the standard in hospitals for YEARS Because religion makes people implement fucked up things that stay cemented in society long after they ve been proven wrong cruel or otherwise morally questionable It s done mainly for cleanliness purposes and tradition That s what they say about female circumcision in the areas that practice it too 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 00:11:22 2018|25|While I completely 100 disagree with circumcision it s usually done on babies so they generally don t have a baseline to compare it to 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 00:09:23 2018|12| Cutting off the foreskin helps keep the penis cleanSo does cleaning it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  9 00:08:26 2018|17|Why are you trying to have a competition about which for of genital mutilation is more horrific 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 23:57:47 2018|18|That would be the point for me Fewer people whining that they weren t invited to the wedding 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 23:13:12 2018|26|I think people should do whatever they want for the things pertaining to their wedding and just understand that not everyone will be able to participate 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 22:55:40 2018|20|Dude you know I report your new usernames to mods You re not even going to try avoiding me huh 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 20:32:51 2018|14|I m not interested in arguing with you about what constitutes a drinking problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 20:09:31 2018|18|Yes they probably do Just because alcohol abuse is normalized doesn t mean it isn t a problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 19:53:21 2018|13|I m impressed that the insurance company covers IVF That s extremely rare 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 18:23:36 2018|14|Why did you delete your other reply hours later and write a new one 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 16:30:01 2018|24|That something would probably be the fact that she seems proud of her multiple negative behaviors despite admitting that she was a bad date 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 15:20:16 2018|17|If someone gets off their face incoherently drunk every few months they have an alcohol problem yea 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 15:13:07 2018|21|Well at least you acknowledge how terrible you are I guess I m sure he s glad he dodged that bullet 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 15:00:50 2018|72|TIL I wonder how we can conclude that s from sexism though There are a lot of ideologies that push smaller family size due to the world being over populated and being familiar with a lot of Korean culture I wouldn t be surprised if that was something they encouraged I am still wondering what TFF stands for in the original comment though I honestly can t think of what they mean 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 05:44:25 2018|20|How does fertility relate to sexism Why does living in a sexist society have correlation to how fertile they are 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  8 04:57:48 2018|13|I have a feeling this thread is going to devolve into racist bs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 21:54:32 2018|33|Yes she actually does need to tell us how she knows men don t get told the same things especially since a man is literally telling her he gets told the same things 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 21:50:56 2018|21|I like how you re telling him when he has been told It must be an amazing experience to be clairvoyant 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 21:40:55 2018|45|Actually I don t see an example in there of where they specifically told her it s because she s a woman She just says they re telling her that and assumes she wouldn t be told the same thing if she was a man 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 21:31:08 2018|169|I dunno I have plenty of fellow traveling friends and a lot are men We all get told similar things To be safe or that an area could be dangerous Heck my friend Bill just had a hundreds comment long Facebook thread about this very topic because he was tired of people always telling him how dangerous it is to travel alone Realistically there are some places that we as women should take extra caution traveling to alone or not And I don t think acknowledging that is a bad thing But being told to be careful in general is not limited to just women It comes from a place of caring and sometimes xenophobia but it s generally not gender based If you have hordes of people telling you that you need to be safe specifically because you re a woman I d reevaluate my friendships if I were you You sound very young and inexperienced and that would definitely get a be careful from me as well 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 20:30:26 2018|6|That is what pro life means 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 20:13:08 2018|8|I was encouraging you to do it asshole 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 20:07:36 2018|22|Feeling you don t have a right to tell others how to live their lives is literally what being pro choice is 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 19:39:36 2018|22|So you hit him first and he retaliated Maybe he should go to a men s subreddit for support and sympathy too

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 06:39:30 2018|9|What was the joke you played that went poorly 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 05:28:19 2018|9|Y all this is obviously a troll come on 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr  7 00:56:11 2018|27|If you re in customer facing jobs being pleasant is a requirement If you can t meet that standard you need to find another line of work

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 21:56:40 2018|21|The wrong idea of what How is saying men are 40 of abuse victims the wrong idea That is a fact 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 21:42:36 2018|1|Why 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 21:33:24 2018|17|Why Do you think every article about women being abused should be accompanied by information about men 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 21:16:21 2018|25|And you re using the fact that women are abused more often as an excuse to downplay the very real problem of men getting abused 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 21:11:45 2018|28|Engaging in a pissing contest and whataboutism about who has it worse is a really great way to keep people from listening to anything you have to say 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 20:06:46 2018|30|That doesn t really make any sense Finding some women sexy doesn t mean someone finds all women sexy It s easy not to sexualize someone that isn t sexy
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 19:12:29 2018|49|There isn t anything wrong with finding women sexy dude You just can t be a creep because of it Seeing a half naked woman is naturally going to bring about certain thoughts That s fine Leering or touching or saying inappropriate things is where it becomes not fine

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 17:36:02 2018|33|But where in this exchange does it point to him doing it purposely or because they were women He seemed confused she corrected him and he went to the back of the line 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr  6 17:24:36 2018|59|I called out some woman who tried to cut in line at the airport That was funny Cutters are lame and people act entitled This just seemed to be a confused person It sounds circumstantial that he was cutting in front of women It s a bit xenophobic to assume he was being sexist just based on his ethnicity 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 20:23:16 2018|7|Have you tried not being an asshole 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 17:33:21 2018|12|Because she is a woman and asking for other women s experiences 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 14:11:43 2018|28|Sorry you re hurting Good that he wasn t honest though You never want to be with someone just because they didn t know how to say no 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 14:09:07 2018|139|You want her to be more traumatized Not everyone is as affected as others by sexual assault I ve been full on raped twice and it really hasn t been a big deal to me It sucked at the time but I have no lasting emotional scars from it You hear about the women whose lives were ruined over rape because stories like mine don t pull an emotional punch There are plenty of women who have gone through similar things and weren t very affected by it That s not to say anything negative about women who were We are all people and we process and cope differently If she doesn t want to make a big deal out of it that s her choice Respect it and be open if she ever does decide it bothers her 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 14:01:09 2018|25|Yea I didn t want to throw a man accusation because I generally don t like when people do that but I agree with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 13:31:19 2018|34|Most of the bigger guys I ve slept with felt as though having a big penis was all they needed to do to please a woman I ll take average any day over that

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 03:02:16 2018|15|Why don t they ask her Why is what we prefer relevant to her preference 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 00:31:37 2018|19|When people are discussing life experiences why should her experience not be equally as valid as anyone else s 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 00:29:58 2018|73|Why are you assuming that I man even on this sub or trollx when someone asks about the broad experience of women the women who don t fit the victimization narrative get criticized by other women for sharing their story Frankly though you re one of the people that has actively participated in that attempt at silencing by calling people men or misogynists so I wouldn t expect you to agree with me 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 22:35:56 2018|76|You re replying on the assumption that OP is somehow incapable of understanding that she shouldn t push into a conversation and imply that someone s experience is bullshit OP seems to be talking about when women are all discussing their experiences hers is frowned upon because it doesn t play into the women are victims narrative Just because she shares that she hasn t experienced something doesn t mean she invalidating the people who have 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 22:16:30 2018|69|Y all act like it s unheard of for feminists groups to be intolerant of women aren t as gung ho feminist and constantly feeling victimized by men in every aspect of their life Look around this sub It happens daily You implying that it s somehow OP s fault that she s treated like that is just as invalidating as what you re trying to claim she does 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 22:07:30 2018|15|If the discussion is about the experiences of women why shouldn t she share hers 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 22:04:11 2018|9|So you equate men hitting on women with disrespect 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 22:01:29 2018|101|I get accused of being a man on this sub frequently once by that user even because I don t follow the narrative You ll find a lot of support here from a few of the more moderate women but unfortunately the majority of the support will come from actual misogynist men who just like it any time someone disagrees with something a woman says And you ll find a lot of attitudes like that person you re responding to Unfortunately online is the place for black and white thinkers so it s tough for those of us that see gray 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 21:56:59 2018|13|Something tells me they re not calling you ugly because men respect you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 21:51:08 2018|75|A lot of the time yea I m a feminist but I m not feminist enough for the feminists and I m too feminist for the non feminists Thankfully only online and in extreme real life niche communities which I just avoid though I m empathetic to a lot of the issues feminists stand for and I just consider myself lucky that I don t spend my days trying to find ways to be offended 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 21:00:29 2018|58|You must have misunderstood your doctor Essure and tubals are both technically reversible but neither are considered a reversible form of birth control as the chances of conceiving after reversal are pretty low Essure is easier and less invasive than a tubal with a much shorter recovery period so that s why docs push it over a tubal 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 20:08:58 2018|6|Essure is not marketed as reversible 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 19:47:09 2018|13|Plenty of people still get tubals Why don t you want Essure though

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Apr  4 14:05:35 2018|13|I guess you have some kind of reading comprehension problem I m sorry

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr  3 15:29:01 2018|18|This is perfect though I am on the fence as to whether the OP is satire or not

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 20:55:52 2018|12|She s having an abortion He had no social or legal obligations 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 20:37:55 2018|42|It s not a child and it doesn t belong to anyone It s something growing in her body that she is removing She can tell him whatever she feels comfortable telling him She isn t morally obligated to tell him anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 19:07:00 2018|30|So I m unclear about the point you re trying to make are you equating rampant sexual abuse by church officials to someone getting a dirty look on the train 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 17:55:04 2018|23|Why do you find personally attacking me necessary Are you incapable of having a discussion without insulting the person you re talking to 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 17:49:35 2018|47|It doesn t say that she hasn t or that she has and you are basing your advice on the idea that she hasn t There s no way to know which is the case I m in my 30s so yes I have had a few 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 17:44:31 2018|19|It s not in her post whether she has shared that with him or not You are assuming Hellooooooo 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 17:03:16 2018|83|The issue is that she was in an abusive relationship and has trouble discussing difficult things with a new partner so she s asking if she really needs to tell him this It s right there in the OP Instead of just going on what she has said you re jumping to other conclusions that aren t stated anywhere It s absolutely her prerogative whether or not she shares this with him As you can see people have different ideas on the topic

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 15:56:47 2018|5|Yes it is the same 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 15:40:11 2018|84|Neither of us know what type of precautions they were taking My guess is an IUD since she s taking a pregnancy test every month But either way it really doesn t matter because she got pregnant How and why isn t really the point She s pregnant and doesn t want to be so she s taking care of it and wondering how much she should divulge to her brand new partner The answer to that is however much she feels comfortable divulging 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 15:26:26 2018|59|To some people maybe But I don t date people who are insistent on knowing every aspect of my medical history right off the bat The fact that she s pregnant currently isn t really important since she won t be pregnant soon So whether being pregnant is make or break doesn t really matter since that s temporary 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 14:51:48 2018|69|It s not really hiding something if you don t divulge every single detail of your life to a person you ve been with for three months honestly I went into the doc for a small surgery 4 months into my relationship and I didn t feel comfortable telling him about it Now I would but we weren t serious enough then for me to be that open yet 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 13:30:56 2018|42|If you see if a future with him I d say tell him Just because it might be awkward if it comes up a few years down the line But it s totally your prerogative There s reasons to choose either route 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr  2 13:23:52 2018|36|I m guessing she s on an IUD if she takes a test monthly but really at this point it s irrelevant She s pregnant and doesn t want to be so she needs an abortion

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  1 18:16:46 2018|14|They re nice I use them w my cup on Days 2 and 3 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  1 17:08:33 2018|22|I have never felt that way but I know you are far from the only one that has You are not alone 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  1 15:46:28 2018|23|It s only a week If you re that worried about it just leave them at home and abstain or use your fingers 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  1 15:44:32 2018|11|Call the doc and see if they can prescribe you zofran 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  1 00:33:07 2018|22|Things like that need to be deemed medically necessary and if someone isn t diagnosed with anything it s not medically necessary 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr  1 00:26:44 2018|16|How much money you make doesn t mean you know any more about medical related things 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 22:04:15 2018|18|I m not hurt I m just letting you know how narcissist and idiotic this entire thing is 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 21:02:22 2018|11|Can you show me where I said anything about your gender 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 20:54:55 2018|87|Yoire right it s not a competition But you re choosing to share inaccurate information You were an MA as I said it s a respectable job but to lord it over people like you re somehow supremely medically trained is ridiculous especially when you re giving out inaccurate info A lot of people without experience in the medical field would think that job title meant you achieved a degree and had a lot of schooling You went to school maybe for a year Get off it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 20:50:33 2018|16|The reproductive system can be examined through the rectum if that is what the patient chooses
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 19:55:16 2018|46|The reproductive system can be digitally examined through the rectum Most people would not opt for that but we tended to see it a bit more often in very religious women who felt as though their vagina couldn t be penetrated by anyone but their husband 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 19:34:36 2018|26|No I will not stop wearing skirt and it s comical that you actually think your opinion is important enough to make a video about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 19:27:48 2018|52|And since you felt the need to mention that you are a former MA which is a respectable job but don t act like you ve got some kind of supreme medical training after a year at most of school I should add that I was an OBGYN nurse for four years 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 19:19:23 2018|40|They wouldn t do it during a Pap test as they would already be entering the patient vaginally but during a well woman exam the patient and doctor can opt for a rectal exam in lieu of a vaginal one 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 19:18:02 2018|61|No people can opt for a rectal exam if they don t want to have a vaginal digital exam Obviously a Pap smear makes it necessary to enter the vagina but in a well woman exam without a pap the exam can be done rectally if the patient requests it or the doctor thinks it is better and the patient agrees 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 18:26:20 2018|1|No 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 15:29:57 2018|58|According to your post you have only been doing these hookups for a little while If you continue with the direction you are going without any reflection you are going to continue having this stuff happen But you seem resistant to this idea so like I said I wish you the best Hope you find peace Take care 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 15:16:10 2018|51|Well you posted in on Reddit so you re going to get all different kinds of responses If you don t want to reflect on how you view men and sex that s your choice but things like this won t get better for you in that case Best of luck 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 14:36:16 2018|23|Yea this is all you bud If you know her why wouldn t you say hi You re not approaching strangers are you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 14:26:34 2018|156|It is heartbreaking and you probably have but it isn t your fault There is no way for you to know during a hookup whether a woman feels inclined to have sex for validation If she is involved in things and moving them forward encouraging you to continue even when you ask if she might not be into it etc there is no way for you to know how she is really feeling about it OP s situation is fairly common so if you hook up with people chances are you have hooked up with someone like her But that doesn t mean you did anything wrong You can only go by people s words and body language and if all of that is saying yes you can t read her mind to know her thoughts are otherwise I hope she and all the women that regularly regret their sexual encounters get the help they need 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 14:11:55 2018|33|I think going to a therapist would be a good thing for you You are having sex for validation and your views on men are extremely skewed I hope you find peace someday 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 04:07:30 2018|66|Eh on Reddit I have been accused of being an SJW a rabid feminist a man AND an MRA On these subs that skew strongly in one direction people are really quick to throw accusations the minute you show even a moderate viewpoint That said there are a lot of MRAs here but disagreeing with an OP on a feminist subreddit doesn t an MRA make 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 31 04:03:08 2018|14|Rectal exams are done in lieu of vaginal exams for a variety of reasons 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 22:41:26 2018|14|Most of the women I know in their 40s and 50s are very happy 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 22:39:40 2018|1|What 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 21:25:51 2018|34|I would probably cut my trip short and go home to my husband if this happened to me However you cope do what is best for you and your family I m so sorry 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 14:43:23 2018|16|Oh I see it now There were so many countries mentioned I must have missed it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 14:27:59 2018|11|Well in his circle of friends that could definitely be true 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 14:19:04 2018|20|Crazy story So glad your mom didn t send money But I might have missed where Nigeria comes into play 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 04:02:27 2018|125|Open communication is very important in a relationship and if someone s needs or expectations aren t being met they need to communicate that to their partner The couple can either reach an agreement where everyone is moderately happy or they can each find a person that fits their ideals better While in general there are certain thing that seem to be man work or woman work there is no reason why it needs to stay that way but it s necessary to speak up about it before resentment arises You keep responding as though people s individual fixes for this problem are invalid but that is exactly how change happens It doesn t shift all at once It happens one couple at a time 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 03:58:05 2018|18|Why are you responding so defensively to people who are giving varied solutions to the problem at hand 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 03:56:53 2018|5|I kind of love you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 30 01:36:10 2018|27|Wow You are making the very best of your situation and should be proud of the amount of emotional strength you possess Best of luck to you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 21:09:48 2018|62|They are carrying food for them in their bodies They don t need to bring bottles There s no need to add an extra step into traveling with a newborn because some people are incapable of understanding why breasts exist And breasts are not genitalia They re a secondary sex characteristic and the literal reason for their existence is to feed babies 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 19:05:15 2018|19|Sounds like you have social anxiety It makes it feel like everyone is watching you but they aren t 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 17:55:35 2018|12|This isn t super uncommon Don t beat yourself up over it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 17:26:59 2018|6|Why did you post this again 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 17:26:20 2018|26|I d suggest getting involved with a professional specializing in this sort of thing You re not coping well on your own and help is available 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 14:44:40 2018|8|What kind of professional help are you getting 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 13:55:48 2018|20|Just spit ballin but have you considered reading articles before commenting on them I know I know crazy thinking right 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 13:53:51 2018|28|Good thing most women care more about their babies getting fed than the inconsequential opinion of a person who isn t involved in any way shape or form 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 13:28:16 2018|7|Louis CK wasn t accused of rape 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 01:35:17 2018|40|Guys gossip a lot too It s just not known as gossip And personal anecdote I work with a bunch of women and one dude and that one dude is the most gossipy one there is He s the worst 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 29 01:28:55 2018|16|No it s not Dudes gossip but beyond teenagers that kind of talk is not common 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 23:07:36 2018|31|So being supportive of a woman whose expertise is being criticized bad but being supportive of the woman expecting her to have been capable of seeing the future good Got it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 23:02:58 2018|46|What part of Hope it s nothing too bad was bitchy Don t come to these forums and blame people for things they can t control Your doctor can t see into the future It s bad luck not a failure to do her job properly 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 22:55:27 2018|35|Well you re vilifying a woman because she couldn t see into a future if being supportive of you is telling you that is an okay thing to do I m fine not being supportive 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 22:24:49 2018|27|You said in the post that it has evolved and looks different now It didn t look bad then She s a doctor not a fortune teller 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 22:09:43 2018|23|You re young and have never been in a relationship so of course you don t know what falling in love feels like

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 20:00:56 2018|12|It probably didn t look like it was HPV a year ago 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 15:40:19 2018|4|That s not compassion 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 15:34:12 2018|16|A class or training isn t going to change the latter nurse into a compassionate person 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 15:09:56 2018|47|Uh sorry but this comment seems to imply that nurses aren t generally compassionate It usually comes with the territory Not knowing the protocol is a problem I agree but not because victims won t be shown compassion We don t learn that part from a class 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 05:36:25 2018|3|An old soul 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 05:19:25 2018|17|I ve always liked reading through r askwomenover30 it s laid back and lots of different viewpoints

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 02:48:26 2018|36|To be fair Disney movies feature a bunch of dark not child friendly shit I m not saying they should feature someone who had an abortion but to pretend like everything is sunshine in Disney flicks 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 02:45:27 2018|25|I mean you re accusing your boyfriend of rape That s a pretty serious accusation from someone who doesn t even remember what was said 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 02:11:43 2018|91|Your feelings are your own He is 100 within his rights to say that sex is a required part of a relationship with him That is a normal standard to have If you felt guilty about him sharing his feelings that his needs were no longer being met that isn t his fault So you made the choice to stay in the relationship and have sex with him right You didn t choose to leave the relationship and be single or to find one where having regular sex wasn t necessary 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 02:00:44 2018|8|So coercion means he used threats or force 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 01:50:43 2018|11|How did he coerce you into it What did he do 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 01:49:07 2018|4|My period never left 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 28 00:56:10 2018|25|Having your period again doesn t necessarily mean the entire endometrium has grown back especially not after just two years Get an ultrasound and see 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 23:02:05 2018|44|Don t hold the newborn and wear a mask if you re in the same room Wash your hands thoroughly and touch as little as possible Better if you just don t go at all but if you do take a lot of care 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 22:58:58 2018|13|I once had an autocorrect from dad to date and that was weird 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 22:04:44 2018|6| 2nd choiceQuite the Freudian slip P
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 21:20:28 2018|13|I don t think you re connecting the dots quite right But whatevs 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 20:00:19 2018|25|What part of my comment suggests she does I m replying to a comment about compromising in relationships That s part of a successful marriage 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 18:46:08 2018|19|They can t use one cup for the rest of their lives Wow you don t even know that 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 18:39:50 2018|54|Why though We don t get free things for other stuff that is inevitable in life so I don t know why that would get special treatment Plus a lot of young girls just starting their period would not feel comfortable inserting and removing a menstrual cup no matter how detailed the instructions are 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 16:38:51 2018|7| that s what happens in successful relationships 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 16:25:59 2018|50|The fact that you keep calling it my wedding sure is weird It was his wedding too And you decided to let him have his dream wedding like many men do for their brides I m sure you can have a smaller vow renewal ceremony to meet your needs too 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 13:47:11 2018|38| Have girls that you ghosted come back ever No because I don t date girls and I m not a socially inept child with the inability to communicate whether or not I have interest in seeing someone again 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 13:13:07 2018|18|Yea a kid deserves love from the people she s living with Why is that even a question 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 01:40:32 2018|15|TIL not criticizing people over things that are none of your business is kissing ass 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 00:45:03 2018|6|Then they aren t your friends 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 27 00:32:32 2018|15|I just don t care what random people have to say about what I do 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 20:18:34 2018|33|Not to be rude but she probably isn t even thinking about you or your attendance at her father s funeral You are likely the only one stressing out about this at all 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 20:07:56 2018|25|Is this a girlfriend or a friend I ve never heard anyone expecting a friend to fly across the country for a parent s death 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 18:02:56 2018|23|No I don t think most men are out to hurt me so nothing about their strength makes me horrified Jealous though Totally 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 18:01:54 2018|14|Great way to show interest in a person and encourage them to approach you 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 16:42:25 2018|43|Then he can choose whether to stay or go Telling her shes fat isn t going to accomplish anything but making her feel extra bad about herself when it s likely her weight gain is due to some personal issues to begin with 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 16:40:37 2018|25|So what does telling someone who is fat that they re fat accomplish if they already know it s having an effect on their relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 16:17:36 2018|31|She knows she has gotten fat so there is no need to bring it up directly Just make a plan for groceries meals and exercise that you can both stick to 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 13:51:38 2018|92|First paragraph ruined it for me There are two schools of thought when it comes to what fuels the gender pay gap Feminists tend to point to systematic discrimination arguing that through various means over the course of women s lives they are pushed out of higher paid work into underpaid or unpaid labor Anti feminists argue that women themselves are the problem suggesting that women tend to be too dull lazy or frivolous to compete with men and choose instead to take on less challenging careers or a life of domesticity 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 02:36:44 2018|10|I m fine embracing my smooth legs You do you 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 02:19:05 2018|24|Sounds like innocently playing around that went further than what OP was comfortable with No need to plant any seed that it was nefarious 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 26 01:53:10 2018|38|Come up with a word or phrase that makes it clear one of you isn t playing around When either of you says it the other stops immediately Always makes me think of the Cacao sketch in Portlandia 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 25 15:39:30 2018|23|I think it s great So long as it isn t super cold and you re not wearing it in a formal setting 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 25 14:33:20 2018|21|Yea low ponytails don t hurt me but they make me look like a 1990s librarian which I don t like 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 25 14:23:55 2018|54|I know everyone is saying your hair is pulled too tight but this happens to me when I have mine up loosely or if I wear a headband for more than a few hours some of us are just sensitive to this stuff If you find an answer to your problem let me know 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 25 06:46:51 2018|21|No I don t think that There are going to be people who pretend but that s the case with everything 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 25 06:13:07 2018|43|No nothing wrong with that Kids need guidance until their brains are capable of making mature decisions As long as you clearly explain to them why you ve made that call there s nothing wrong with telling them they can t do something 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 25 03:22:15 2018|4|No they re not 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 25 03:17:47 2018|23|I don t think they need to care specifically about feminism but they should care about equality however they choose to label it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 24 19:39:47 2018|27|If he has a demanding job I m sure sometimes it s nice to sleep in and then just decompress alone on a Saturday for a while 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 24 16:01:53 2018|5|What is sexist about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 24 05:41:25 2018|10|Well you re also being a complete dick about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 24 04:57:19 2018|30|I dunno why anyone is trying to com ic you of anything Your opinion is completely irrelevant to anyone but yourself and the people you choose to have sex with 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 24 04:39:48 2018|9|You most likely do since most people have it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 24 00:07:29 2018|3|It s negative 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 23:20:07 2018|7|So then what s the problem here 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 23:03:11 2018|15|Sounds like a normal hormonal teenager to me Does she not want him touching her 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 21:54:38 2018|15|Sure I m not the one here arguing with parent comments in the first place 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 21:49:10 2018|18|And there would be more people needlessly assaulted or killed over a material possession that can be replaced 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 20:58:23 2018|18|I don t think people should be encouraged to put their safety at risk for things like this 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 20:41:30 2018|28|If you have the urge go right ahead I just don t think it s good to tell others they should be putting themselves at risk like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 18:52:36 2018|27|Sometimes Sometimes not I ve been assaulted in public and seen assaults in public It s about 50 50 as to whether anyone retaliates in that way 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 18:05:11 2018|21|I think more people are smoking because of its legality I haven t seen a huge upsurge in specifically female smokers 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 17:42:55 2018|20|Like I said I m glad things didn t go awry for you Your heart was in the right place 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 17:41:24 2018|6|I could do without your attitude 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 17:25:37 2018|37|So did those women go up to the creep and confront him yell at him Removing the victim from a situation is different than walking up and confronting a harasser abuser person with no regard for others 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 17:24:07 2018|18|Hey you can make whatever choice you want I value my own safety over that of a stranger 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 17:13:36 2018|13|Yea contacting the train bus operator or proper authorities is a social check 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 16:53:55 2018|20|Yes I absolutely am And I ve also gotten to my 30s without being murdered so that s pretty cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 15:33:59 2018|55|Honestly I would not advise people to do things like this It can be dangerous I d alert the bus driver train operator or security Warn the potential victim and be ready to call authorities if necessary I m glad it didn t go awry for you though Your heart was in the right place 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 15:04:12 2018|35|I just stop engaging and message the mods when I figure out it s her Though her abusive comments that she Edits out after a few minutes are a new thing at least towards me 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 14:43:15 2018|70|The stupid bitch comment was under her link But I just realized that she is the user that keeps getting banned and making more names You might have known her as u haute crimes u icecoldhotdog u SammySposa u armpit rash u Braided Bread u SemperFeminina u ill mace you u big ass cactus u boobs akimbo u Ciega sordomuda u nice try jan u killallben u lionsleepsalone u FoxMulderberry
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 14:33:56 2018|6|I didn t edit my comment 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 14:26:48 2018|10|Likewise I don t see any sources from you either 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 14:10:44 2018|33|I think at a core level they all want the same things so potentially yes but in practice there is too much minimizing and what aboutism to make it actually true in practice 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 14:08:34 2018|31|Sorry I work with kiddos and that is unfortunately not true While I don t agree with the MRA mindset or tactics the actual basis of their complaints does have validity 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 13:58:30 2018|25|So if you read my post history you must have seen my comments about endometrial ablation Are you unsure of what an endometrium is or 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 13:50:15 2018|27|Where did I say anything about hating them You quoted old white guys in charge and complained about the phrase Which part of it isn t true 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 06:14:16 2018|13|I didn t get Congress from anything since you didn t say Congress 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 06:12:41 2018|4|No it isn t 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 06:07:59 2018|40|What are you averaging The President and Senate Majority leaders are both over 70 The VP is 60 next year The only not old one out of that whole bunch is Paul Ryan But he sure is a white guy 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 05:54:19 2018|36|This post is a little confusing Is the first person supposed to be labeled as male Also why on earth would you want shitty women to be in office They re no better than shitty men 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 05:51:18 2018|8|Are the old white guys not in charge 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 03:18:07 2018|26|No a normal guy wouldn t almost get into a fight with a person for looking at a woman wearing a short skirt in a bar 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 01:48:32 2018|72|What s the point of writing like that At any rate you are making the claim that women are getting sexually assaulted at office jobs left and right so that s why it s dangerous and terrifying So far there is nothing you ve written to back that up Certain jobs are annoying and oppressive as a woman Dangerous and terrifying is hyperbole and at least OP admitted it You can too 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 01:40:31 2018|14|I don t need to There was a sexual harassment suit not sexual assault 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 01:35:22 2018|8|So which of those was an office environment 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 01:29:29 2018|7| right and people get arrested for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 01:26:47 2018|24|Lying about it for sure was bad Just the commenting on photos may be a bit of an unclear boundary unless it was discussed 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 01:25:47 2018|13|Hey hun generally sexual assault is looked down upon in an office setting 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 00:07:57 2018|36|Commenting on porn accounts is weird and cringey but I don t know if it would constitute as cheating to most people Have you in the past discussed the boundaries of your relationship pertaining to that 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 23 00:03:50 2018|24|What was dangerous and terrifying about it Chicago has a lot of murders but I didn t realize they happened in an office environment 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 23:53:14 2018|4|Where do you work 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 22:58:45 2018|15|Girl you need to look for a different job if yours is terrifying and dangerous 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 18:53:57 2018|9|Oh so she was asking for it I see 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 18:42:47 2018|17|You seem to be implying that what someone wears affects their chances of being sexually assaulted huh 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 18:36:09 2018|20|Yea and This was their choice no different than if they chose to go to the party wearing something revealing 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 18:20:04 2018|16|The girls knew what the outcome of the game would be for the losing party right 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 15:32:31 2018|14|Yes thanks for putting that way more simply than I was able to do 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 14:50:53 2018|78|It s tests to see if someone is of a certain fitness level That level is generally different depending on the sex of the person A woman who can do only 10 push ups is much more physically fit than a man who can only do 10 push ups So of course the requirements are going to be different to display someone s physical fitness but it doesn t mean that they re incapable of performing the job 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 13:32:36 2018|7|1 2 5 minutes2 2 5 minutes
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 13:30:33 2018|25|There are differences between men and woman that make peak physical fitness fall into different parameters No amount of equality is going to change biology 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 13:23:13 2018|9|Yea I forgot how many guys get ablation surgery 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 05:21:58 2018|9|Did he not have his wallet for a cab 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 03:53:20 2018|5|I m an anti Nazi 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 03:16:37 2018|1|No 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 01:58:25 2018|9|You don t need to apologize for your opinion 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 01:51:18 2018|26|I m moderate in a lot of ways but I don t think I m right wing Though far left people may accuse me of that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 22 01:33:30 2018|53|That article wasn t even worth reading tbh She could have just written Online dating ladies Am I right and it would have been equally as pointless At any rate I don t really see anything overtly feminist about what she s saying On a sidenote I have had massive success online dating 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 21 15:50:04 2018|14|Is this really necessary Pregnancy tests aren t hard to use to begin with 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 21 08:10:13 2018|17|Try slow FE It s control released so it your body is more likely to absorb it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 21 08:08:57 2018|44|Infusions tend to be reserved for extremely serious cases and they come with their own special side effects Plus if you need a full unit of iron you ll need to take an entire day off work because the process takes about seven hours 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 21 08:06:38 2018|53|Unless she s extremely anemic without the ability to absorb any iron orally insurance is not likely going to cover an infusion They re not a casual walk in the park as you describe you re lucky if it was that way for you and tend to be reserved for very serious circumstances 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 17:30:56 2018|19|I don t think most arguments that are pro circumcision focus very much on the pain aspect of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 17:06:38 2018|22|Great And just so you know AHS is not the same as the Humane Society of the United States Confusing I know 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 16:07:55 2018|17|They do this in Minneapolis through Animal Humane Society You might reach out to them for information 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 15:19:26 2018|43| They still sounds like a plural to a lot of people so it s hard to automatically default to it when speaking of a singular person I only remember to use it when speaking of a specific person who has requested that pronoun 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 13:31:02 2018|10|Your trolling didn t work out quite as planned eh 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 13:27:22 2018|19|I don t care at all Maybe it will evolve Maybe it won t I m fine either way 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 05:44:12 2018|15|If it hasn t been used in 4 years I wouldn t worry about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 00:30:27 2018|12|Well then it looks like you found a good doctor for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 00:29:50 2018|30|You should probably maybe do your research beyond your own personal anecdote before suggesting someone makes a report to a medical board which could potentially jeopardize a person s career 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 20 00:22:48 2018|29|Pretty sure your mom is a grown adult woman with her own agency and you don t get to decide what she should or should not be upset about 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 23:47:15 2018|39|Rectal exams in lieu of vaginal exams are a thing No need to report him to the medical board She just knows now to speak up and decline that route if it s something she d rather not do 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 18:40:48 2018|20|Half or more of the country identified Trump as the piece of human garbage he is but he still won 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 16:48:21 2018|10|Ideally Elizabeth Warren but I dunno if that is plausible 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 15:14:51 2018|12|I wouldn t be surprised if the next president was a woman 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 13:58:23 2018|18|Omg what a trailblazer Really making a difference Making the world a better place by being a dick 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 13:32:26 2018|31|Im guessing the pizza place is probably owned by dude and his wife so they can get away with considering it woman co owned though that s a pretty loose criteria 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 13:30:34 2018|18|What s your MO besides being condescending and unsupportive of all the people who post on this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 13:26:20 2018|27|It has to be both woman owned co owned and have a woman head chef to be considered woman led Or is it an either or thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 06:06:44 2018|3|It is flair
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 04:19:15 2018|18|I mean the entire incel sub called themselves incels They literally made up the name to call themselves 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 03:55:26 2018|4|They call themselves incels 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 03:44:08 2018|14|Again the judgement on incels has nothing to do with sexual experience at all 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 03:39:52 2018|10|Incels aren t getting judged because of their sexual experience 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 03:26:37 2018|19|You should probably get used to it because most adults communicate with a lot of people regardless of gender 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 03:11:47 2018|4|I now understand why 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 03:10:08 2018|34|There is nothing wrong with having friends And I have never met anyone that arbitrarily lists the names of all their friends to their partner So they just come up in conversation over time 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 03:05:18 2018|19|I guess the answer to where was your husband might be trying to avoid his nightmare of a wife 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 19 02:15:35 2018|8|Oh she is one of those JustNoMIL posters 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 23:58:06 2018|7|Where was your husband in all this 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 23:57:04 2018|11|So what kind of conversations have you two had about this 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 22:46:53 2018|17|Are you really so bored that you need to make up multiple personalities on Reddit little boy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 22:43:39 2018|9|This is a you problem not a woman problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 22:40:48 2018|51|There s a lot to unpack here but therapy is probably where that should be done It s fucked up to pressure someone into getting sterilized and it s also fucked up to pressure someone to do something they aren t comfortable with sexually Frankly sounds like a pretty toxic relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 19:20:57 2018|13|This is your cousin s problem and you re getting way too involved 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 07:01:01 2018|9|What is a femoid Are you talking about fibroids 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 06:59:02 2018|4|I love this autocorrect 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 06:31:57 2018|26|I m not getting defensive I just though since you replied about having a pixie cut you felt it was somehow related to what I suggested 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 06:22:30 2018|9|I didn t say to get a pixie cut 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 18 05:36:46 2018|32|Split ends cannot be repaired they are like a run in a stocking The longer you leave them the further up your hair shaft thy will travel Just get a hair cut 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 18:11:13 2018|30|Considering it was posted at like 3 7amish on a Saturday morning in the US where most redditors live it probably flew under the radar of a lot of people 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 16:03:43 2018|31|You are more interactive than most and you don t seem to let your personal opinions on topics affect how you mod as long as the rules are not being broken 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 15:57:04 2018|5|You are a good mod 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 15:54:06 2018|35| Would they have asked a guy my age 3 times if he were married At a medical office Yea probably would ask all the same questions minus anything having to do with menstruation or pregnancy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 06:10:52 2018|31|I do have to add though Simultaneously patting yourself on the back for being good hearted and caring while spewing insults at someone you don t know is pretty hilariously hypocritical 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 05:13:18 2018|69|She obviously knew her weight would be a likely issue or else she wouldn t have hidden it from him in the first place That is deceptive If she is honest with her pictures and the people she chooses to meet she can be with a person who doesn t mind or even likes that she s fat She s only putting herself at a disadvantage by hiding it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 04:51:23 2018|19|I would react harshly to anyone who has chosen to lie to me for an extended amount of time 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 04:38:24 2018|50|But she didn t have the maturity to be honest about the way she looks If they planned this rendezvous as a possible sexual situation he has a right to feel deceived Why would he want to sit and talk it out with someone who obscured the truth from him 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 04:33:37 2018|17|You should post accurate pictures of yourself online if you are planning to meet people in person 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 02:35:59 2018|9|It isn t a child nor is it murdered 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 01:38:06 2018|4|Why isnt it reasonable 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 01:29:44 2018|5|Who says I don t 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 00:39:09 2018|9|Nearly every day that I m not at work 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 00:26:42 2018|30| You guys have to be fair and accepting of all opinions right No Your opinion on something you don t experience is irrelevant and no one has to accept it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 00:23:37 2018|6|You didn t answer my question 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 00:17:39 2018|38|Its just really funny when someone says something they don t experience is no big deal Well no fucking shit buddy of course it s not a big deal if you don t have to deal with it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 23:40:05 2018|6|So how often are you catcalled 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 21:45:37 2018|22|And the teacher said if you prefer to work in the lunch room you should continue doing that and you re offended 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 21:31:00 2018|38|If you re a caregiver where else would you be besides in the classroom caring for children Your post reads like you started in the middle of a story where we all know the context but we dont 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 21:18:46 2018|13|It s unclear what your role or job is Please be more descriptive 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 20:58:12 2018|41|I was considering mentioning them too As well as the patients in the waiting room and outside the clinic The abortion is not dangerous to them either In fact you and I are also safe when someone else gets an abortion 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 20:28:48 2018|5|The person getting the abortion 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 20:27:27 2018|48|I work out 6 7 days of the week alternating between HIIT weights yoga jogging and bouldering Usually pick two of those per day I stay motivated by my desire not to be a soft blob and my desire to like myself when I look in the mirror 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 19:06:30 2018|7|Yes I knew this was a thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 17:52:24 2018|24|I wouldn t really say that it is being called out The writer just explores the community and then gives her opinion on it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 15:40:21 2018|48|No It s likely just to get your attention and responding will give him what he wants If he does kill himself it s because he has guilt over being a piece of human garbage not because you didn t reach out He s trying to manipulate you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 15:12:26 2018|85|You were suspended for disrupting class and refusing to discuss things respectfully with the dean I would have suspended you too If you want to be taken seriously you need to keep your composure and mention things at an appropriate time rather than impeding on everyone s education I am assuming you re a teenager You haven t learned how to be assertive without being disruptive and annoying You ll learn eventually hopefully but until you do don t be surprised when this happens again 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 15:06:00 2018|32|I think there are other posts discussing this But anyhow it s a double standard perpetuated by both men and women and I don t see it going away any time soon 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 09:43:06 2018|19|I think if you can t accept people disagreeing with aspects of your post you should rethink posting it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 09:32:47 2018|50| Right because you mention commenting on someone s appearance in the OP and that s what I think isn t a great idea Commenting on behavior is fine so there isn t any reason for me to include it in my critique of what should t be said to strangers 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 09:17:55 2018|55|I m not talking about whether compliments are sincere or not I am talking about how they are received and whether it s appropriate to give input on a random stranger s physical appearance Those kind of compliments should be reserved for people you know who you are certain won t feel uncomfortable or threatened 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 09:01:58 2018|100|I actually don t think giving unsolicited comments about a person s appearance goes over well often enough to encourage it I personally am okay compliments but I think on the whole people 1 don t take them well it makes them very uncomfortable 2 think if it s a guy complimenting they re creeping or hitting on them or 3 think if it s a woman they re being sarcastic or catty So unless if it s about an article of clothing they have I don t think commenting on anything physical on a stranger is something to encourage 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar 16 08:46:12 2018|56|Saying these products may cause itchiness or pH problems is a lot different than the phrasing and mocking tone of the person I was talking to But you and I seem to have a different idea of what kind of tone is appropriate when discussing things with people so I wouldn t expect you to agree 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 23:52:48 2018|27|I don t understand what the question is like how long out is it usually scheduled Or are you asking literally how long the scheduling process takes 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 21:07:21 2018|41|They re are so many reasons why he may have started walking and then turned around Being aware is fine but make sure you aren t searching for things to make into a problem That seems to be the case here 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 20:53:03 2018|28|If he is the one that stopped the bus I d wager a guess that he meant to stop there and it had nothing to do with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 19:38:37 2018|23|I think many people who read the original news story were interested in a follow up due the craziness of the original story 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 19:06:11 2018|23|When someone is manic or depressed they are not thinking clearly and bad decisions like using meth do not seem like bad decisions 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 19:04:44 2018|23|It s v interesting that all these different people have found this post when it has been removed for about an hour now 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 19:00:40 2018|14|I am familiar with your username and know that you are the same person 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 18:57:33 2018|14|She has bipolar disorder and was untreated making her more susceptible to use drugs 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 18:48:03 2018|13|Maybe if you weren t being a raging bitch people would be compassionate 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 18:37:57 2018|14|Jesus Christ lady she s talking about the OP of the comment Calm down 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 18:20:49 2018|21|They definitely have tests to see egg quality and fsh production though Not fool proof but certainly a good starting point 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 18:03:50 2018|33|You asked why she said what she did and she answered Is there a reason you asked for advice but chose to respond condescendingly and defensively to almost every person who answered you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 16:50:36 2018|66|I think people should mind their own business about what others put in their vaginas that s all No need to say the product someone prefers shouldn t be produced just because they don t like it If scented stuff irritates you don t buy it Read the package before doing so Don t imply that other people are weird for their preferences That s it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 16:28:03 2018|43|Not really a decision anyone can make for you Requires a lot of self reflection and knowing your own capabilities and desires which none of us here really know This is more a discussion for you to have with someone close to you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 16:14:51 2018|29|Many people use scented tampons just fine and don t get yeast infections They shouldn t be made to feel bad about other people not reading the label clearly 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 15:42:25 2018|12|I don t care if you disagree with me calling him out 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 15:40:25 2018|22|No there are people that choose to buy scented tampons and there s no need to make them feel bad about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 15:35:34 2018|49|No I think he needs to consider why he d make a statement about something he knows nothing about He can say he didn t know they were a thing but he should be called out for then trying to back up his opinion with ignorant statements like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 15:25:12 2018|14|If you don t know then why are you trying to input your opinion 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 13:10:34 2018|4|Because people buy them 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 04:31:07 2018|26|They don t It s just rare that anyone has cycles that are identical so inevitably over a period of time they will eventually happen simultaneously 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 04:09:56 2018|15|I get along with all my friends mor else I would not call them friends 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar 15 02:16:28 2018|31|I don t would not out anything In the pockets of jeans even if they did hold a lot They are fitted to my body and it would ruin my curves 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 22:41:07 2018|47|Yea it s a bummer but everyone has to make choices in life and they re not always easy ones There are a lot of choices where you will always wonder what if Just try to embrace whatever decision you make and make the most of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 20:57:31 2018|5|At least you re honest
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 20:53:03 2018|11|Yes And What does that have to do with her story 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 16:52:14 2018|98|White women have had a hold of feminism forever and suddenly feel threatened when people stand up and say I want to be represented in this struggle too Donald Trump is president because of white women Roy Moore almost beat his opponent because of white women And I m a white woman But I know what people mean when they talk about White Feminism and think it s a valid critique I m not about to get notallmen ish on something just because I happen to fit the physical profile of the group they re taking issue with 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 14:43:25 2018|33|I ve never been in a workplace or known any pregnant person that has waited until the third trimester to disclose their pregnancy so I wouldn t say many people make that choice 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 14:27:47 2018|25|If you have unlimited sick days and can work from home how exactly are you expecting your pregnancy to have any impact on your career 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 01:43:27 2018|8|Probably need new friends if yours aren t 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 01:12:08 2018|25|Yes random hookups absolutely help relieve sexual frustration You know yourself better than anyone else to decide whether you can do it without developing feelings 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 00:58:20 2018|26|Doesn t bother me They re just joking It s not a big deal and it doesn t sabotage or interfere with what I m doing 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar 14 00:35:38 2018|33|No Unless they re forcing pizza into my mouth hole and making me chew and swallow they aren t interfering with my health plan I can say no I can order the salad 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 19:28:26 2018|13|It s okay to call out friends but a year later Pretty petty 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 19:08:49 2018|10|I don t see why this is productive or necessary 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 17:48:16 2018|9|You should go to the doctor for a UTI 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 17:09:38 2018|26|Is advising you not to overreact not advice when you are asking how you should react Like just breathe and focus on things that actually matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 16:46:43 2018|8|Not sure what s up with the attitude 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 16:16:39 2018|47|I mean if you told him to stop and he apologized why are you worrying about this From your description this seems to be the first time you used your word to tell him to stop and he reacted appropriately Kinda putting the cart before the horse 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 15:53:35 2018|10|Has he done anything after you told him to stop 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 15:03:20 2018|43|Probably a bit more pressure to be social as a woman but I don t particularly care if people are dumb enough to consider me cold and distant just because I m not constantly out and about That s their problem not mine 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 13:38:23 2018|62|Again in your opinion that s the case but it may not be perceived that way from others perception It may be perceived as casual But I think I m repeating myself now and this isn t really an important topic by any means since I don t care how people choose to wear their hair Rock in with your ponytail girl 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 04:05:37 2018|70|You are using the shitty arguing technique where you change the subject of a discussion and then try to argue that instead of staying on topic I forget the term for it but suffice it to say it s used when someone can t actually refute what a person has said But now I m going to block you because you have yet to contribute anything worth reading Take care 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 03:14:46 2018|84|You seem to have gone into your own aside not quite related to OP s post or what I said either there but I will address it There are certain things that are appropriate for certain jobs If men are required to look put together and well groomed so should women And vice versa If not then whatever But if someone is unable to allot themselves enough time to look job appropriate and get to work on time maybe they need a different job

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 00:21:43 2018|5|So are you a woman 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar 13 00:04:43 2018|36|I don t know what you disagree with It s vastly more common for men to murder their female partners than for women to murder their male partners so it s a realistic thought to have 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 23:52:15 2018|15|Because those two things are commonly mentioned and real fears when it comes to dating 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 23:33:29 2018|43|A ponytail often has the connotation of being casual Like oh I m just hanging out at home gonna throw my hair back on a ponytail and be done with it Whereas a braid or bun implies at least a bit of effort 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 22:50:41 2018|17|Might be seen as too casual Maybe make it into a braid or a bun next time 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 22:49:14 2018|21|Honestly It really doesn t seem any harder than being a boy It s just a different kind of hard sometimes 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 21:53:42 2018|28|You can t control other people If she wants to go back she will Just give her positive support for as long as she is away from him 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 21:17:12 2018|12|It is probably for the better Dating coworker is a bad idea 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 18:25:21 2018|39|As someone who used to work in ob gyn my only suggestion is to make sure your midwife is also a licensed ARNP It s much safer and they are much more prepared for anything that may pop up 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 16:30:25 2018|22|If you have gained weight in your torso your breasts are not going to look as proportionately big as they once did 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 15:08:33 2018|46|Because your body hasn t fully adapted to or accepted the birth control I didn t say anything about how long you ve been on it But this is really easily googled so try doing that instead of asking me questions and arguing with my answers 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 13:57:57 2018|12|Your body hasn t fully adapted to or accepted the birth control 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 07:18:22 2018|17|Not that I agree with the concept but most women wouldn t need it for 40 years 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 03:29:31 2018|24|That s not true Being on hormonal birth control prevents the uterine lining from building up so it doesn t need to be shed 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar 12 03:26:26 2018|11|I m not reading all that What s the TL DR 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 11 06:05:09 2018|57|If you got them done at a salon they aren t natural highlights You get those from the sun Your hair was bleached And if you get highlights once a year unless you have cut off all of your hair from the previous year which maybe you do only about 6 inches of your hair is virgin 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 11 05:38:58 2018|65|I m not going to get into an argument about the technical side of cosmetology with you I have dealt with it enough on the job which is why I m mostly retired from it frankly Don t feel like doing it on the Internet with a random know it all Of course you know more than the people who do it for a living 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 11 04:07:23 2018|35|How is speaking on behalf of other women lifting anyone up Do you think she doesn t have agency of her own to decide whether or not she s okay with being called my girl 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 11 03:37:08 2018|11|It s offensive to you She wasn t talking to you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 11 02:49:18 2018|28|If OP has a problem with the term she can say something Don t speak on behalf of others about something that is by no means universally offensive 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 11 02:24:34 2018|3|2014 is New 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar 11 02:03:09 2018|21|The hair that you got bleached had already been bleached before so it is going to be more fragile and damaged 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 23:52:46 2018|27|Calm down not everyone views animals and people the same way They probably don t have pets for that reason No need to get so worked up 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 23:02:04 2018|12|To boil True Detective down to a show about boys is ridiculous 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 20:53:52 2018|20|Except it should limit people from potentially harming a bunch of children But I think you re a troll anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 19:45:56 2018|16|A human I just met a few months ago will never take priority over my dog 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 18:25:02 2018|45|Sorry to say but regardless of how inappropriate you think his dogs are they were there before you he is far from the only person that has that prerogative Find someone who shares your views on pets and he can find someone who shares his 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 16:51:45 2018|10|I always liked Groove is in the Heart by Deeelite 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 16:49:01 2018|19|I gotta say it s not necessarily an insult My friends and I call ourselves that all the time 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 16:47:06 2018|21|Oh yea that makes sense I guess it didn t occur to me since it was two or three days ago 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 16:46:44 2018|21|Oh yea that makes sense I guess it didn t occur to me since it was two or three days ago 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 16:33:27 2018|5|What does the hashtag mean 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 15:50:39 2018|18|No OP do not get the edges razored It will not do any favors for your hair texture 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 15:33:21 2018|21|Chances are you have some social anxiety and aren t super comfortable around other women so you notice their actions more 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 11:53:59 2018|18|At one job I am required to wear it but at my other job no pressure is felt 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 00:41:40 2018|5|Anecdotes aren t really useful 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 10 00:34:39 2018|48|Nah there are just more ways of exposing their behavior beyond talk about it in a circle of friends It s like when people say there is more sexual harassment or child molestation or violence now There actually isn t News of it is just more easily accessible 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 21:59:53 2018|32|Nah I don t really mind it either I wouldn t go out of my way to have someone use one on me but when I need it it s not bad 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 21:55:48 2018|36|That s good to know I keep hearing rave things about the book while most people I know hated the movie I might have to read the book Are the characters less dry and better developed 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 21:23:38 2018|7|Her name was Lena not Nina BTW
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 19:46:08 2018|28|That was rude of him I d probably say go fuck yourself or something to that degree and perhaps grab a security guard since he was physically abusive 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 18:40:30 2018|18|Yes the world is full of different opinions on art and media None more valid than the other 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 18:21:18 2018|13|I liked most of the hair And the bear thing was pretty cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 18:15:13 2018|15|Why else would someone call something garbage other than because they didn t like it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 18:10:49 2018|29|Because she wanted to stop the Shimmer but like I said I don t even like the movie soon offense to you but I am done discussing it P
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 18:06:17 2018|26|Yea I hated the movie but am interested in the book because I heard it was much better And that it was a very loose adaptation 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 18:02:22 2018|51|That is assuming 1 it is all a single entity with shared memories and 2 it was the replicant that took the grenade and not vice versa They put the blackout in there for a reason It was a cheap and predictable way to make things and who s who ambiguous 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 17:52:17 2018|17| She tricked the replicant and destroyed the shimmer and made it out alive OR DID SHE dundundun 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 17:51:17 2018|7|Yup or even Terminator to an extent 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 16:52:38 2018|26|She s not going to get very far with policing things like that based on her own personal preference It s not a universally offensive term 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 16:36:35 2018|35|I dunno what is defensive about what I ve said You responded to my comment so I answered And you re right not all women have vaginas so I should have used a different qualifier 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 16:29:05 2018|23|From your perspective it doesn t That s subjective and that s fine My perspective is different Also subjective also fine Happy Friday 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 16:23:26 2018|30|He wasn t referring to her He was referring to his team who is working for him She isn t working for him She is the head of the company 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 16:08:24 2018|37|I m not asking you to agree with me I m sharing my opinion about the problems in the film industry You re entitled to your own opinion but I m not going to argue with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 16:06:33 2018|22|Is that a question He was referring to the team he worked with not her She wasn t included in my girls 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 15:43:40 2018|64|Because there are plenty of movies that involve men as main characters that do not revolve around an unnecessary romantic subplot but for women those kind of movies are severely lacking Even Wonder Woman had to shoehorn it in for no reason when nearly every woman led movie has the main character making her decisions based on a man there is still a problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 14:50:51 2018|26|Trying not to be spoilery but also Her decisions were based on her love of a man rather than advancing her 100 relevant line of work 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 14:33:24 2018|52|I hated almost everything about it Not the least of which that It is being touted as progressive simply for having dry undeveloped women as the main characters Still falls into the same status quo as any other movie and the ending was completely predictable Some of the visuals were cool though 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 06:21:04 2018|53|No The word for a young human is child and kid is the actual word for a young goat and a colloquial term for a young human The word for a female human is woman and chick is the actual word for a young chicken but a colloquial term for a human woman 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 06:12:19 2018|18|What s this we business Speak for yourself not anyone else I m fine with the word chick 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 06:06:22 2018|53|There isn t one and someone is bound to get pissed no matter what you choose as you can see by the we aren t baby chickens tirade so don t sweat it There was a post a few hours ago about girls and you might want to read the convo there too 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  9 05:59:25 2018|54|This is just as varied as the girls debate I personally say call em whatever you want If a person takes issue make a mental note and don t call or refer to her by whatever word she dislikes Chick seems to be dude s counterpart though in my experience so it s fine 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 23:44:56 2018|2|November 19
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 22:45:07 2018|29|Yea that is what rubs me the wrong way People are entitled to their own preferences but they shouldn t feel entitled to speaking on behalf of anyone else 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 22:32:20 2018|48|She communicated her preference but he wasn t referring to her He was referring to women who weren t there and she spoke on their behalf without know what their preferences were Just because they re all women doesn t mean she can assume they agree with her 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 22:27:15 2018|70|I first missed the part where you were speaking on behalf of other women who weren t present based on your own preference That s not cool If he called you a girl and you asked him to stop that s one thing It s pretty presumptuous to say you know that the non present women don t like the term just because you happen to be the sam gender 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 21:39:43 2018|20|It doesn t bother me unless contextually it sounds condescending Which can happen with any term girl woman female lady 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 19:37:35 2018|23|I don t think any wouldn t allow it However depending on the job certain looks are more advantageous when looking for employment 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 19:20:36 2018|31|She needs to go back to a therapist You are not her therapist and it s not in you to treat her for her mental disorder Encourage her to get help 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 19:14:36 2018|6|What professional help is she getting 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 19:10:14 2018|44|Oh okay Yea I don t see any reason why you can t leave it long If it was a job where you needed to look super trendy and stylish I could maybe understand But wearing it in a bun should be just fine 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 19:04:33 2018|10|It depends on what you plan on doing for work 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 18:40:56 2018|32|Yes Viewing men as incapable of caring and sharing for fear of not being seen as masculine enough is definitely a problem that needs to be addressed starting with our young boys 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 18:38:53 2018|49|You seem to be taking what I said really personally But anyhow what I said applies to it being a work holiday I don t necessarily think it should be celebrated that a woman with obvious privilege chose to give everyone the day off For the reasons mentioned above 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 17:52:00 2018|137|While I think the idea is ok I m hesitant to encourage it Just like I didn t encourage the day without women last year Why Because it s an exercise in privilege You know who won t get a paid day off on Women s Day Most of women who need it The woman who has to work two jobs because her kid won t get dinner otherwise The migrant worker who is in the fields 80 hours a week and hasn t had a day off in 10 years Etc etcThey don t get weekends They don t get paid holidays And I feel like someone in the a position who does get those things proudly announcing that they re taking the day off is a bit of a slap in the face to them 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 16:42:11 2018|16|How can you claim to be feminist but then blame women for the decisions men make 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 16:38:55 2018|12|Pretty uncool to blame women like me for the choices men make 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 15:00:55 2018|19|I m bi and have dated bi guys Our sexuality wasn t really a factor since we were monogamous 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 15:05:20 2018|32|They re definitely whiny if they can t be arsed to do a two second google search and see they already have a day They re just commenting to make a stir 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 14:24:14 2018|18|No one should have to change their preferences just because some people won t use the word no 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 01:32:22 2018|14|It is almost as if people have varying likes and dislikes in sexual situations 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  8 00:06:43 2018|4|You re emotionally abusive 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 22:36:33 2018|21|Well you are being abusive and horrible so she shouldn t really have to do much to convince him of that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 22:33:35 2018|39|I a woman personally feel like explicitly asking to do something ruins the mood It makes me feel like the person is incapable of reading body language and non verbal cues and that s a real turnoff for me 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 16:28:27 2018|11|OP asked what we would do not about her own situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 08:01:51 2018|53|So you actually think the cops are going to come and you ll be able to press charges because people are making faces at you in a restaurant You can t fathom why your girlfriend wouldn t want to waste her time on something that would never happen Can t help you there 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 07:55:13 2018|13|Use your words and talk to your girlfriend We aren t mindreaders either 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 07:46:31 2018|15|There isn t anything to deal with I don t see a problem with it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 07:45:03 2018|7|How is this relevant to this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 07:43:21 2018|16|Pretty gross and probably something you should keep to yourself But wrong is a subjective term 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 03:53:12 2018|24|This is productive thanks Do you want to agree to disagree or go back and forth repeating ourselves I m going with option 1 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 03:30:13 2018|6|Everything in life has gray area 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 02:28:01 2018|52|I don t really think you need to do away with those thoughts as they are are natural It s a sign of maturity to be able to sympathize and empathize with a person who is going through a hard time regardless of how you feel about the way they arrived there 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 02:25:44 2018|77|Your feelings seem to be pretty normal I think a lot of today s climate paints things as extremely black and white You are seeing gray area and that s a completely normal and human thing for you to do As long as you can show your friend sympathy and provide her support you are being a good friend regardless of whether some of your thoughts are not so sympathetic You re just human It s okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 01:30:10 2018|106|I mean I m currently a hair stylist and have been for 10 years and that is absolutely how much I d charge for that service if not more since I live in a city that is bigger and more expensive than Tuscon But that s neither here nor there at this point You re repeating what I said numerous times but making it sound like you re arguing with me It all should have been discussed beforehand If she didn t know to do that the stylist surely did Hence my comment to leave a bad review as I said it should have been discussed 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 01:03:32 2018|106|General rule is to discuss pricing beforehand If she didn t know to do that the stylist surely did Hence my comment to leave a bad review Also having grown up with my mom being a professional hair stylist and knowing a thing or too about what procedures and worth it certain areas types of places I can confirm right now that OP was ripped off anyways Your mom being a hairstylist when you grew up doesn t really have anything to do with what things cost now Those prices are completely normal at any decent salon but as I said it should have been discussed 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Mar  7 00:57:06 2018|30|It might have something to do with his seemingly sincere apology in which he took complete accountability for his actions That plus time are probably two of the main factors 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 23:40:21 2018|14|leave a bad review about them then It all should have been discussed beforehand 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 22:18:14 2018|24|You both should have discussed the price beforehand It wasn t mentioned at all by either of you until the end of the service 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 19:21:25 2018|10|I am in the medical field and am heavily tattooed 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:57:45 2018|63|That s why I used water as an example But we already know you have a reading comprehension problem since your entire premise was built around me getting angry about the seat But listen cupcake I m sorry you re so sensitive and can t handle people having different opinions than you Put that passion into learning to adequately read maybe Take care 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:43:23 2018|73|It does matter though Just because I m capable of fixing the problem doesn t mean it doesn t matter that it happened in the first place If my husband left water out on the counter I m capable of putting it back in the fridge if I want it to be cold but that doesn t mean I should have to do it when he is the one that left it out 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:36:30 2018|33|Yes And that doesn t change anything about what I said in my FIRST comment of the chain But having an opinion on what the default should be somehow triggered your delicate sensibilities 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:33:14 2018|7|I already told you what I do 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:31:53 2018|30|He hasn t left the toilet seat up in three years So apparently what happened is he understood why it should be down so he doesn t leave it up 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:29:14 2018|14|I use the restroom and tell my husband he needs to keep it down 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:25:12 2018|31|You need to answer my question first Your whole premise is built on me being angry so I d like you to show me where I said I d be angry 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:19:45 2018|21|Bodily autonomy extends past death Which is funny considering there s such a debate about it when it comes to abortion 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:07:21 2018|2|Yea And 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:06:39 2018|6|Yea who cares about bodily autonomy 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 18:01:41 2018|13|Can you show me a comment where I said anything about being angry 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 17:51:49 2018|39|Let s unpack why it bothers you so much that not everyone shares your opinion on the toilet seat How is my opinion harmful to you in any way If it isn t harmful why does it bother you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 17:41:56 2018|7|What is unreasonable about having a preference 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 17:08:50 2018|56|If he doesn t want to change he s not going to change Save yourself some grief and just don t discuss this stuff with him If you and your mom are being treated unfairly support each other in standing up to him but is a tv show really the hill you want to die on 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 17:02:55 2018|10|Uh I think you must have read a different OP 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 16:46:19 2018|11|Why shouldn t adults get praised every once in a while 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 16:30:10 2018|26|Or not getting shit done Sometimes we need a day of rest But then I guess the shit getting done is self care so it applies 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 16:29:15 2018|2|See ya 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 16:23:32 2018|36|You asked Can we come to a consensus about the toilet seat and that s my opinion on what should happen Why did you ask the question if you didn t want a variety of answers 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 15:53:35 2018|5| Im sorryNo you re not 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 15:03:10 2018|23|Why should she have to leave her own flat because this fuckface can t take no for an answer It s her home 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 15:00:37 2018|8|Found the guy who pressures women into sex 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 14:59:42 2018|14|She says right in the post that he is forceful when he s drunk 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 14:52:46 2018|19|Your message is extremely vague What is the end goal and how are you encouraging people to achieve it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 14:31:10 2018|31|If you are having issues with social media Why don t you try to do something in real life for whatever cause you re trying to support unclear what it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 14:28:04 2018|16|Coercion to participate in sexual acts while under the influence or not is definitely sexual assault 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 06:20:58 2018|1|Why 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 05:19:04 2018|28|How I see this issue incel makes a stupid post on a women s subreddit and some guys are like yea see women are a bunch of dummies 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 05:17:40 2018|11|I can t believe anyone actually thinks this is a woman 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 03:40:29 2018|33|It hurt after I had it done and that s about it Can t think of any other negatives other than that it grew back but for me that wasn t a negative 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 01:52:40 2018|67|I am a little creeped out that you think you have the inside scoop on sleeping with my husband At any rate I m not sure why you re so set on arguing Dude asked why someone wouldn t look and I gave two reasons They are actual reasons that exist and things that happen regardless of whether you agree with the logic behind them or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 01:36:44 2018|31|You cut off the second part of my sentence But at any rate not everyone has the luxury of non noisy doors unfortunately So it may wake a partner either way 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 01:18:15 2018|20|People who use the bathroom at night and don t want to wake their partner blind themselves with the light 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 01:02:30 2018|6|Shit what ll they do now 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 01:01:06 2018|38|Out of the four main bodily functions involving the toilet men peeing women peeing men pooping women pooping 3 4 of them involve the seat being down so it would make sense for the default to be down 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Mar  6 00:57:38 2018|6|Let s not go that far 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar  5 23:53:06 2018|18|The article is about women The title doesn t specify that though So the title is the problem

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar  5 20:22:26 2018|32|Sometimes friends grow apart There s no reason to keep trying to hang on to friendships where that happens No one is wrong in the situation you re just different people now 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar  5 14:55:42 2018|9|What type of professional help are you currently receiving 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar  5 14:54:07 2018|14|You ll forget about it in like a month Focus on friends and school 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar  5 08:49:56 2018|23|Pretty sure you can find erotica for your jerking off needs in plenty of places on the Internet rather than creeping here dude 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar  5 05:30:05 2018|64|If you think internalized misogyny means being condescending toward women no you don t understand what it means There are numerous reasons why you may not hear it in real life Perhaps you don t discuss sexism regularly with people I know I don t Or you flock with similar birds who can t adequately discuss it because they also misunderstand what it means 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar  5 03:31:43 2018|10|I don t think you understand what internalized misogyny is 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Mar  5 03:30:02 2018|19|Why are you comparing yourself to your boyfriend He s dating you Obviously he doesn t mind your teeth 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar  4 03:33:29 2018|26|I m confused as to why you think I said there s something wrong with her decision to seek out films that don t contain rape 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar  4 03:27:44 2018|14|I just realized this person regular posts on r shoplifting What an amazing parent 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Mar  4 03:10:51 2018|53|I am a woman who is into the horror genre and I can name plenty of horror movies without rape scenes Like I said it is confirmation bias If you re looking for something you ll inevitably notice it more and it will seem like it s everywhere That s how that works 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 18:57:51 2018|21|I don t think that it is a man or woman thing though Whatever you re looking for you ll find 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 18:15:16 2018|29|You can say boys all you want but you d be hard pressed to find a group of 55 year old women who would want boys interested in them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 17:18:56 2018|11|If she s dating boys that s reallllly weird and illegal 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 16:28:12 2018|20|My parents had kids when they were in their mid late 30s and are backpacking through Europe in May so 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 16:12:38 2018|15|F that It s absolutely not too late for her to be an amazing mother 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 16:04:22 2018|56|She just doesn t want to watch things featuring rape dude Like people are allowed to choose not to watch stuff I don t like most war movies so I choose not to watch them Did wars happen Do they still happen Yes and yes Why does that mean I have to watch movies about them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 15:58:58 2018|27|Or they don t have confirmation bias I can name plenty of shows that feature rape storylines but I can name way more shows that don t 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 15:52:56 2018|13|Well she s 55 so I reckon she s not interested in boys 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 15:33:28 2018|10|To scare you No honey I m just mocking you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 08:11:56 2018|53|No no benefit at all We would prefer not to have the freedom to make our own choices Our ideal lives are sitting around waiting for white men to come tell us what we need to be doing because lord knows that kind of responsibility is just too daunting for our tiny brains 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 08:06:46 2018|29|I hope someone screen shots this for r iamverysmart I would m it it s hard to see straight with my eyes rolled so far back into my head 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 03:48:58 2018|12|Saying a man will like your body is not spreading self love 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 02:24:04 2018|13|Where does she mention any concern about what men think of her breasts 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar  3 01:43:17 2018|34|You ve lost body fat and breasts are mostly fat You re young so your skin elasticity may help a bit but they re not going to become perkier when they have less fat 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 23:31:28 2018|2|What teenager 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 21:24:29 2018|35|I think outrage about this would be a bit overkill It s not like they are denied menstrual products They get pads for free We don t even get pads for free outside of prison 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 20:43:44 2018|4|Go to the doctor
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 19:39:01 2018|3|Marinate on it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 19:35:21 2018|25|How do the doctors act scared but also act like you re exaggerating your symptoms Seems like that contradicts itself Have you looked into ablation 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 19:12:08 2018|26|Beauty standards don t stop but it s your choice to continue being concerned about them What exactly is going to happen if you aren t 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 18:22:03 2018|5|Because not everyone has menorrhagia 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 18:14:07 2018|23|She told him and apologized Everyone makes mistakes and she stepped up to hers so now we can enjoy how heartwarming it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 17:34:02 2018|14|I don t actually see him mention her or her character specifically at all 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 16:35:56 2018|99|So you are expecting them to contact police in the state of the offender and implore them to go to this guy s house and serve him papers for disorderly conduct Like I get that you re upset but the police have way bigger fish to fry If the guy keeps doing this to the customer service reps at the company I m sure they can fire him as a customer but to expect anything beyond that for an inappropriate phone call is unrealistic And I m still concerned that you think this is on par with sexual assault 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 16:21:24 2018|3|Yea you did 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 16:19:56 2018|71|No It s not on par with those things Stop If the company said to her you have to stay on the phone with this customer or we will discipline you then it would be a problem with the company She can hang up the phone on inappropriate behavior right Did he continue calling and harassing her or was it an isolated time What is an appropriate consequence in your mind 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 15:06:54 2018|57|What does your girlfriend do for work It sucks that it happens but the dude isn t beholden to any sexual harassment policy since he doesn t work there so I think the parties involved did exactly what they could and needed to do So what were you expecting to happen to the guy out of curiosity 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 01:16:34 2018|12|Why do you need a menstrual cup if you don t menstruate 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Mar  2 00:48:04 2018|9|For casual sex I literally only care about looks 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 23:35:04 2018|22|Interesting When I worked at one we asked both First do you still have your period Second when was your last period 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 23:33:06 2018|18|No you re projecting your own issues with aging It s a normal question at places like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 23:29:56 2018|33|And like literally beat her to death not like they were brawling and she hit her head He hit her 19 times AND he emotionally abused his ex wife til she killed herself 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 22:58:33 2018|38|If you were at a fertility clinic that tends to be how they ask regardless of age as a lot of the patients they deal with rarely ovulate or don t ovulate and that s half the battle 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 20:17:00 2018|47|On one hand gross that guy is a scumbag On the other hand he did serve his time and should be able to love on with his life But I m looking at more info about the murder his remorse etc to see how that panned out 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 19:11:34 2018|4|No Just a coincidence 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 15:25:06 2018|4|Yes that s it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 15:16:53 2018|4|Please also r ihavesex
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 15:12:05 2018|19|First of all wow Secondly dude you definitely have trouble with women Hating them falls under the term trouble 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 15:10:07 2018|9|It s like the you wot m8 but forreal 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 14:44:44 2018|11|I can t fathom why you d have trouble with women 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 14:41:21 2018|43|Oh wow The salt Someone has an agenda And it s people like this that then blame women for their lack of dating success It s not because he s a terrible bitter awful person It s because women are shallow Yep s
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 14:33:43 2018|7|Wow dude What s with the disrespect 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 06:53:53 2018|7|Not sure what you re talking about 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 03:26:27 2018|15|A woman is a female human There is not such thing as a woman cow 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 02:55:13 2018|19|Okay so you vaped and y all were irresponsible about it because you re kids It ll be fine 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Mar  1 02:33:40 2018|6|Uh What did you guys smoke 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 23:23:50 2018|1|Lol
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 22:25:30 2018|27|The ability to just be an asshole boss is near equal among men and women in leadership But generally men are responsible for sexual harassment more often 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 21:01:02 2018|9| are you not holding the cup with your hands 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 21:03:51 2018|4|Are you very overweight 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 21:09:36 2018|52|I don t know that s why I m asking Do you have limited mobility that prevents you from moving the cup quickly from one spot to another if the stream moves I m not asking these questions to be condescending I m asking them to help understand what the issue is 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 21:12:57 2018|43|Well that explains it You might have to explain the issue to them and ask them for a urine hat They have those for kids and disabled people so I m sure if you asked for one they could give it to you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 21:57:47 2018|22|Men s fertility is not cyclical like women s so it s a bit harder to make an effective contraception for them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 20:57:13 2018|8|Ya The cup you get at the facility 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 20:59:28 2018|20|wait Bending fat enough to put a cup between your legs while urinating You didn t know it was possible 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 19:58:05 2018|32|It says she already tried twice That doesn t mean she tried at home How would she know it wasn t enough if there was no one telling her what enough was 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 19:36:33 2018|26|Not even an American thing at this point Paps are only every three years for most of the population And frankly never required as OP states 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 19:34:39 2018|20|How is at relevant Obviously she s going to a controlled environment since she s worried about its closing time 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 18:52:52 2018|38|Because they are specialists For basic gynecological care there is no need to see an OBGYN If your issue goes beyond the basic need and this goes for literally anything medical then you need to see a specialist 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 18:50:52 2018|10|They re not required annually unless you have an abnormality 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 18:48:32 2018|33|OBGYN is a speciality though Just like urology for mostly men PCPs are capable of doing the basic exam and pap so anything requires being seen by any OBGYN is beyond basic care 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 18:45:06 2018|33|You just hold it under the stream of urine What is the difficult part Do you not see the stream or do you have urination issue where there is no stream or what 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 16:42:21 2018|3|That s weird 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 16:04:54 2018|9|What was the context of him grabbing your hips 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 15:07:10 2018|32|It is but a lot of people only want a newborn for myriad valid reasons so saying adopting older kiddos isn t really a counterpoint to the idea that it s expensive 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 09:00:51 2018|3|Who Who does 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 04:26:53 2018|88|The definition isn t exactly like a parasite They are similar but the say they re exactly like each other is inaccurate Parasites are not the same species as their host and they at some point Obviously sometimes there are eggs laid that hatch inside the host originate from a source outside the host I m all for defending pro choice rights but I really don t like when pro choicers use shady science to make their point There s plenty of legit science to defend the position 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 01:54:43 2018|19|So then stop hanging out with assholes You really want to expose your kid to that kind of stuff 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 01:13:10 2018|18|I probably would have addressed his intent to take full credit rather than bringing up something completely trivial 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 01:05:07 2018|3|Which kills it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 01:00:22 2018|33| They re not killing anything I mean yes they are I am pro choice and people should do what they want but you don t need to go the way of denying facts 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 00:18:25 2018|38|You re taking years off your life getting worked up over this minor stuff Take a few breaths Take a run with your doggo Let it go Do you have a support system Do you exercise and meditate 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 00:50:18 2018|72| Walker agreed with the lawyer for the defendant that Parks couldn t read statements that other people had posted about the assault on her Instagram account Walker first interrupted Parks when she talked about a crime that had not been chargedThese two things seem like legitimate things not to allow in a court statement I dunno about the last part though That doesn t seem appropriate to leave before she s finished 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 00:52:53 2018|37|Are you really going to plan your life around what other people think Do what you think is best What other people think is tacky doesn t matter Your family planning has not effect on their lives 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 28 00:59:41 2018|15|Pretty sure most people understand what an abortion is when they decide to get one 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 23:11:22 2018|26|Not trying to be rude but if that s the case why did you post here This is a subreddit for women and women s experiences 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 22:45:46 2018|12|Women use Grindr I thought that was a site for gay men 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 21:54:50 2018|35|Most of the comments are supporting her ending the friendship but that doesn t mean we shouldn t be giving her perspective Support doesn t mean turning a blind eye to someone being a jerk 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 21:43:53 2018|128|That s a good question I think if they identify a women and aren t adding anything to their body that isn t already there I don t think it s too similar to this Obviously everyone has varying opinions on this so it must make it hard to make rules and regulations then we get into questions like if someone isn t biologically a woman but identifies as one and isn t taking any hormones to transition so they play woman s or men s sports etc It s all newish murky territory and I don t know if there is an absolute right answer As long as people approach the debate with respect for the people and their gender identity I think the discussion is okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 20:07:11 2018|26|No matter how much joy he brings you he is not respecting your relationship There are many men who will bring you joy and respect you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 19:50:02 2018|33|If my partner kept a person in his life who was actively trying to undermine our relationship I d let her have him because clearly he has little regard and respect for me 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 18:28:06 2018|39|Which I m sure would be fine if he was competing with other boys men I don t think the amount of testosterone to transition to physically becoming a man is included in those exemptions when competing against women 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 17:01:58 2018|21|I don t know who Katie is or why you think I m saying she s immune to my second statement 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 17:06:31 2018|16| so why do you think she s not included in the criticism in my second paragraph 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 17:10:52 2018|16|I m not getting into this again Especially not when I ve been accused of transphobia 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 17:12:41 2018|46|And yet I m not calling either of you derogatory names for disagreeing on how to go about doing that It s a simple difference of opinion yet I ve been dragged under the bus as being transphobic for how I think it should be handled 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 17:18:55 2018|9|Then there isn t anything for us to discuss 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 17:40:31 2018|28|That is next level self involvement to think someone who worked to achieve a better socioeconomic status shouldn t ever discuss their lives or struggles with their friends 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 16:58:02 2018|53|I mean if you read our comments it is clear what we want to happen and none of it implies transphobia It s pretty regressive when these things can t be discussed without one side accusing the other of some kind of evil simply because they disagree with how to handle a situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 16:39:17 2018|115|I think your title is misleading This woman hasn t done anything wrong and the title implies that she did something malicious to you You seem to be jealous of her success despite your insistence that you have chosen to live against the status quo It doesn t sound like it was your choice at all It sounds like life nudged you into it and you accepted it instead of making an effort otherwise At any rate this is your problem If you can t be around her that is what it is but don t end the friendship by framing it as her fault as you have in this post This is all you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 15:53:55 2018|36|You can take a pregnancy test at home to mostly rule that one out at least A lot of autoimmune diseases are treatable and pretty easy to live with once diagnosed No need to panic yet 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 15:48:02 2018|38|This is a man who is putting women at a disadvantage in women s sports and there is no way I ll condone that You re entitled to your opinion too I just don t agree with it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 15:40:10 2018|28|If he doesn t think he should compete with girls then he shouldn t He doesn t need to disadvantage these girls in order to prove his point 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 15:14:08 2018|51|Rosa Parks wasn t in a competition or taking drugs that gave her a significant physical advantage in said competition which are the things I am opposing Your analogy is not great If I said Mack should sit down and shut up about transgender people in sports it would make sense 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 15:08:12 2018|10|What kind of performance enhancing drugs did Rosa Parks take 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 15:02:15 2018|24|I m proposing people work to change the state rules and be barred from using performance enchanting drugs while competing like it most sports 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 14:56:51 2018|70|I m not sure what you re talking about or referring to I am saying that if we are condemning involuntary we shouldn t be cherry picking facts in order to say it was based completely on race It was more complicated than just they were racist They needed people to experiment on and it ended up being those who were compromised in society somehow Slaves poor mentally ill etc 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 14:50:38 2018|23|Yes but if those are the state rules he shouldn t be competing til they re changed He s using performance enhancing drugs 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 14:32:55 2018|17|It can be condemned of course but blaming it specifically on racism is kind of cherry picking 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 14:25:02 2018|19|Why on earth would they allow him to compete while using testosterone Of course he is going to win 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 03:52:57 2018|2|Weed helps 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 03:45:25 2018|32|What part of you are entitled to your opinion was unclear to you Like we don t agree regardless of how many defensive and long winded diatribes you want to go on 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 03:35:43 2018|12|Yes it is still easier to lie online than in real life 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 03:28:55 2018|8|K you re entitled to your opinion too 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 03:27:55 2018|34|I don t really understand what is assholish about encouraging her to meet people in real life rather than investing tons of emotional energy into a person whose identity she can t even verify 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 03:03:53 2018|101|While I agree having menstrual leave isn t a great idea I agree it s her for the most part I mean I don t think dude s opinions matter as much when women are discussing things pertaining to them and vice versa really Just like white peoples opinions on black experiences aren t as relevant as the opinions of the black people go live them You can comment on how it would affect you but you can t really comment on how appropriate having a day or two off for a period would be since you ve never experienced one 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 02:50:19 2018|39|If you didn t meet in real life it wasn t actually a relationship I m sure it hurts but you should focus your time on building friendships and relationships with people you can see and spend time with 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 01:29:13 2018|85|Yea every time I see a post of someone asking how to interact with people or be better at dating I just have to say like you just need to do it You can t expect to have a natural relationship if you re constantly fed lines and advice from other people You re going to mess up and make a fool of yourself sometimes but if you never get out there and do that you re going to be stuck where you are forever 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 01:17:01 2018|57| he d been ignoring some signs from one woman he was talking to that very clearly said she wanted to talk first They re probably not compatible then I dunno if you should be coaching him anyway tbh You re going to be projecting your online dating preferences on to all the women he tries to meet 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 27 01:12:09 2018|27|I m sure he could ask people to meet up immediately Plenty of women are fine with that as long as it s in a public place 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 22:53:52 2018|12|might be a good time to start using tampons in that case 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 22:52:31 2018|9|Maybe your username should be dramaqueen instead of goblinqueen 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 22:37:27 2018|44|Yea I ve had almost the exact same thoughts I m extremely divided on having kids naturally or otherwise You re not alone in these fears I d give you advice but I don t really have any because that s my life too 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 22:22:17 2018|17|I don t know who will be running for president so how can I possibly answer that 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 22:04:25 2018|16|Probably because there s no reason to comment on someone s physical appearance in that situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 18:06:33 2018|115|Yes I know about the water in Kenya but as i said about 50 of rural Kenya does have access to it and it s unclear in the article whether they are talking about an area that has a water crisis or not But if you have further information that says they re talking about an area without access to water I definitely get where you are coming from And if they can t find a way to dispose of the mass amounts of used pads it leaves a health risk There s not really one easy solution but I m sure the people who are managing this will try to choose what s best 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 17:52:34 2018|56|I think it s pretty common I heard metabolism is a bit faster right before your period starts though I haven t really looked much into whether or not that true But other than that it s just hormones Personally I want to eat everything two days before my period starts and then it tapers off 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 17:49:47 2018|58|I don t see in the article where it says they don t have access to water and about 50 of rural Kenya does 83 of urban Kenya Like I said you re entitled to your opinion I think there are a lot of different things to consider and neither of us are members of the Kenya government 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 17:42:32 2018|32|As I said she knows her friend better than either of us so I m sure she d be able to navigate whether my advice is appropriate for the situation or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 17:32:30 2018|25|I mean it depends on how it s approached If they re good friends she could tell her pretty much exactly what she said here 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 17:29:49 2018|59|Yes I do use a menstrual cup All it would require for them to maintain one is water and an occasional boiling I think it would be much easier to maintain and more cost effective than disposable pads with no place to dispose of them But hey different opinions make the world go round You re entitled to yours 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 17:22:28 2018|54|Do they not I didn t see that in the article My other concern would be disposal of non reusable pads which I see they re trying to figure out If they do have access to water I think cups panties would make a heck of a lot more sense considering that aspect too 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 17:19:04 2018|46|I would try to delicately bring it up with my friend and make sure you are thinking of the right person If it turns out to be the same guy there is no need to give him a reason why you are choosing to stop speaking 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 17:17:36 2018|11|That would only work if he was charged with a crime

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 16:18:43 2018|79|Cultural pressure and indoctrination in religious communities is a real problem and Islam is far from immune to that What you re saying is no different than saying How do we know that woman didn t choose to be involved with a man who practices polygamy or Indians in Iowa don t feel compelled or pressured to be in arranged marriages That could be true but there s no way to make that statement without personally knowing a person 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 16:05:23 2018|9|Yea So why would a hijab be an exception 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 16:03:04 2018|23|There is no way to know that either way One s community and family can have a lot of influence over their decisions 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 15:09:17 2018|18|Only skimmed but I think menstrual cups or period panties would be better and more cost effective no 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 07:22:13 2018|32|People who are upvoting your comment must know equally as much about HIPAA as you do Nada It s really not great to give advice about something you have no knowledge about 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 06:00:12 2018|60|As I said If size 14 16 people aren t regularly buying their clothing why would they have reason to think that there would be a big surge of people bigger than that wanting to buy it And right They ll go to plus size stores Because That s what plus size stores are for People who are plus sized 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 05:56:16 2018|16|Or they could just make some clothes with pockets and others without like they already do 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 04:44:23 2018|150|You don t seem to have understood what I said If their larger sizes especially the largest size sold as well as their other sizes or they received a lot of demand they d be more inclined to expand their sizing If size 14 16 people aren t regularly buying their clothing why would they have reason to think that there would be a big surge of people bigger than that wanting to buy it Companies are all about the money And as I said elsewhere Athleta is an athletic clothing company I don t think it is unrealistic to think that they don t get the majority of their patronage from obese people I know there are obese people that are athletic but that doesn t make it cost effective to make a bunch of clothing aimed for them when they aren t the ones who are generally buying 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 04:38:44 2018|17| I think the folks arguing with you moved off the specific to the general pretty quick Bingo 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 04:25:51 2018|81|I m not trying to be crass but I m going to be frank here Athleta is an athletic clothing company I don t think it is unrealistic to think that they don t get the majority of their patronage from obese people I know there are obese people that are athletic but that doesn t make it cost effective to make a bunch of clothing aimed for them when they aren t the ones who are generally buying from them 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 03:33:59 2018|48|I just can t discern if you re upset or not It is the internet and sometimes people sound upset if they aren t But you seem to have taken offense so I apologize that I offended you but I stand by what I said Take care though 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 03:10:27 2018|103|Sorry to upset you or whatever I did admittedly forget that obesity is getting a lot more common and the average size is rising Being a company I m going to guess they keep statistics and keep track of the sizes that sell the most If bigger women were buying the majority of their products or were continually requesting larger sizes I m sure they would begin to carry them Their main concern is making money and not wasting money If there is not enough request for very large sizes as I said it doesn t make sense for them to make them 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 03:04:39 2018|40|I can speak on behalf of myself and all my friends because we have discussed this We choose to wear form fitting clothes in order to accentuate our curves Throwing a bunch of stuff in pockets kind of ruins that 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 03:01:31 2018|59|I imagine being a company they keep track of the sizes that sell the most and if bigger women were buying the majority of their products or requesting larger sizes they would carry them As I said it s likely just not cost effective for them to cater to that demographic but maybe she can get a custom pair 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 02:52:51 2018|65|On a normal scale of clothing sizes in America not sure if you re American 0 is within a normal range of sizes 0 2 being extra small 4 6 being small 8 10 medium 12 14 large 16 extra large especially for workout clothes which people tend to wear a little snugger anyhow As I said though perhaps you can order a specialty pair 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 02:42:17 2018|48|They make up to a size 16 which above average size You can t expect companies to regularly make sizes super far outside normal range to cater to people who are far too big or too small to fit into average clothing It just isn t cost effective 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 02:27:19 2018|16|Will providing men with purses get them to stop me from carrying their stuff in mine 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 02:26:11 2018|38|Yea I understand the gripe of no pockets but they really change the entire aesthetic of form fitting things Men tend to not have rounded hips so bigger pockets don t affect their shape in the same way 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 02:01:38 2018|29|His comments aren t wrong as women or at least people without penises do generally use more toilet paper than men But he should still contribute to buying it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 01:26:14 2018|16|There have been a lot more in recent years I think most of mine have pockets 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 01:14:28 2018|9|Yes no and yes my styling routine was different 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 26 01:13:17 2018|35|Not really interested in carrying a smartphone in the pocket of my jeans Messes with my shape since my jeans tend to be skinny slim formfitting I like flowier dresses or skirts with pockets though

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 24 07:35:55 2018|31|Yea if you try to do that without someone s consent and then get mad when they tell you to stop that is sexual abuse The fuck are you on about 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 24 07:34:05 2018|13|Oh shit Janet doesn t think I m a feminist What to do 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 24 07:29:18 2018|154|Oh so you were referring to I had oral sex with someone or had someone perform oral sex on me without their consent by Or i put my penis men only or I put my fingers or objects all respondents into a woman s vagina without her consent by Or I put in my penis men only or I put my fingers or objects all respondents into someone s butt without their consent by Or Even though it did not happen I TRIED to have oral sex with someone or make them have oral sex with me without their consent by Or Even though it did not happen I TRIED put in my penis men only or I tried to put my fingers or objects all respondents into a woman s vagina without their consent by Or what Which one of those is equivalent to saying someone is gay for not making a move 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 24 07:22:36 2018|41|Interesting that You omitted the first part of the question which says I fondled kissed or rubbed up against the private areas of someone s body lips breast chest crotch or butt or removed some of their clothes without their consent

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 23 20:20:52 2018|23|It shouldn t be normal to accuse someone of trickery just because they didn t do everything according to your own perfect plan 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 23 19:19:10 2018|23|You seem set on just making a very normal situation into something with malicious intentions so there isn t much I can say 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 23 18:54:29 2018|48|How do you know that that was his intention at the beginning Why is it out of the realm of possibility that developed feelings for her and eventually asked her to hang out one on one I m so sick of people demonizing every action a dude takes

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 23 14:38:03 2018|108|Yea You ll run into this a lot while single And probably also when you re not Honestly you just need to clearly state that you are feeling smothered and tell him to ease up If he can t respect that make it clear that the friendship isn t working and stop responding to him It sounds harsh but the clearer you are with these people the better If you let it go on too long he ll pull the nice guy routine it has already begun with all the bells and whistles and make you believe you led him on or did something wrong You didn t

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 23 04:00:11 2018|39|It could have been stated with more finesse but the fact that men are generally stronger and excel in most sports isn t sexist It s true Women generally excel more in sports that require flexibility and weighing less 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 23 03:36:47 2018|98|I don t know why you re bring Saudi Arabia into this Anyway your question is rhetorical but you need to understand that your upbringing wasn t normal and most families would frown on it You may think you see it elsewhere but you don t know the dynamics inside of families I m sure it happens but allowing one child to severely abuse the other to that extent isn t normal I m sorry you dealt with that So did I But I am not going to attribute it to something hat is acceptable to the masses

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 18:22:34 2018|72|Hey me too But it went on for six years As far as menstrual leave goes though you have to understand that not everyone experiences periods like that In your case or mine a regular medical leave would be adequate because it s a medical problem A period itself isn t a medical problem so there s no need to treat it as one or give special accommodations because of its existence

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 17:03:07 2018|16|Yea purposely leaving blood stains on things isn t gross at all what am I thinking 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 16:49:58 2018|11|You can still do you without bragging about your gross habits 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 16:45:19 2018|7|I throw away sheets that are stained 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 16:39:43 2018|17|I think people simplify this too much in both direction to try and prove their own point 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 16:37:49 2018|16|You don t wash blood stains out of your sheets Do you happen to be single 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 15:55:11 2018|13|We don t know your fianc or his preferences You should ask him 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 05:34:27 2018|66|Right they should But writing in the title that specifically GIRLS are not allowed to say no is misleading and paints it as something that is targeting girls rather than all the children The headline doesn t say girls The article doesn t say girls other than that the mom who was upset has a daughter Yet the title specified girls It s pandering and disingenuous 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 05:28:46 2018|16| did you read my comment fully or just skim it and decide to have a tantrum 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 05:11:07 2018|51|Every time this story is posted here and it is a lot it has the misleading title that girls aren t allowed to say no NO ONE is allowed to say no girl or boy That is a stupid enough rule No need to make it seem specifically aimed at girls 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 04:33:42 2018|27|So you haven t had a fever at all One of the main symptoms of the flu is a high fever I wouldn t worry about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 02:58:01 2018|7|This is not relevant to this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 02:19:50 2018|17|99 isn t actually even a fever so I wouldn t worry too much at this point 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 02:17:58 2018|57|Don t panic It is a bad flu season but the news is also just trying to scare the crap out of people as usual Lots of people are getting the flu but the majority of them feel like complete shit for a while and then get better Does your fever go down when you take Tylenol 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 01:45:18 2018|40|They will still charge her money though If she thinks her life is in danger she should go to the hospital but if she has just been considering going to urgent care I don t think that s the case 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 20 01:37:42 2018|74|How long have you been sick If it s been more than 48 hours Tamiflu won t work and they will just tell you to do exactly what you have been doing to treat it The flu sucks but it s a virus so you really just have to ride it out It sucks but it would be a waste of money to even go in if it s been longer than 48 hours 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 23:44:12 2018|3| Like the dictionary 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 23:40:43 2018|10|You re within your rights to feel however you want 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 23:38:32 2018|23|I just think picking and choosing which dictionary definitions we do and don t honor based on subjective opinion is a slippery slope 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 23:34:37 2018|1|Yikes 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 23:31:51 2018|32|I mean it s both an adjective and a noun by definition I understand the preference of people not using it as a noun but that doesn t make it bad English 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 23:28:31 2018|11|I get this dehumanizing part but it isn t grammatically incorrect 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 23:25:06 2018|14|It isn t really It just has some negative connotations that woman doesn t 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 23:11:01 2018|25|Bothers me mostly just because the context of the majority of comments about females are negative generalizations I don t mind the word in general 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 20:27:53 2018|18|If your whole life hinges on marriage and a kid nothing But most people aren t that boring 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 18:07:26 2018|97|I mean the doctor doesn t have unlimited openings They need time off too It s kind of a no win situation for them If they re fully booked they can t just pull new spots out of thin air If they shorten appointments to fit more in a day people will say they felt rushed in and out Usually there are a few openings for emergency cases per day but as you said you are healthy Now you know that you need to make an appointment further in advance for your next check up Lesson learned 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 16:29:56 2018|17|So you don t go anywhere and put in no effort Yes that would make it difficult 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 16:20:10 2018|34|Being non binary isn t new but at any rate I don t see how people being open wth their gender identity would have an effect on women or womanhood That s their business 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 08:32:38 2018|65|Answering your question and saying you should spay your dog The horror If I was going to be judgmental in my response I would have gone into depth about how mindblowingly stupid the question was But I didn t I simply answered your question and said you should spay your dog Your snarky stupid fucking question asking ass got sassy and now here we are 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 08:07:09 2018|8|Nothing about your post makes me feel good 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 07:33:04 2018|6|No And please spay your dog 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 03:11:57 2018|26|Absolutely right that not everyone can make the change But for the people that can and choose to do so it helps more than just themselves 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 03:10:54 2018|11|I don t think you absorbed my entire sentence Try again 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 02:40:47 2018|2|Oh okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 02:32:10 2018|70|No I have lived in a couple different urban areas for 15 years or so The possibility of being a victim of assault by a random person in a public place is just not high enough to make me fearful period The chance of it happening is much lower than the chance of it not happening At any rate thanks for your invalidating attack on my personal experience Very nice 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 02:15:58 2018|59|No I m literally saying that I have no reason to feel unsafe in public places as attacks in public places aren t common enough to make me feel unsafe Most people in public places travel through them unscathed on a daily basis so I don t have any reason to think I won t be one of them 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 02:04:40 2018|2|What is 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 02:03:50 2018|40|Because it isn t tied to my gender But that s beside the point as what she quoted doesn t say anything comparing men to women yet she is arguing with me on the basis of men compared to women 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 01:44:39 2018|52|It is that simple If people would just put their foot down more often half of these societal pressures that are felt wouldn t even exist for millions of women Clearly they can t change society but they can change how they personally deal with it and that s how paradigms shift 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 01:40:19 2018|57|Welcome to the working world This may be the first person you ve dealt with like this but it won t be the last If you quit every time someone like this works with you your resume is going to look very bad for the future Concentrate on yourself and doing a good job not on others 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 01:36:35 2018|6|The word is friend not freind 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 19 00:22:50 2018|113|So you picked an argument with your boyfriend over something you already knew you disagreed on Sounds like a healthy relationship People develop their opinions based on life experience and the people around them He is probably in the camp that fetuses are innocent and don t deserve to be put to death but if someone commits a heinous enough crime they deserve to die I don t agree with it but I can see why some people feel that way It s unclear what you re looking for with posting this though You picked a fight with your boyfriend and now you re mad about it What are we supposed to do 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 18 23:58:48 2018|14|It doesn t require having children to empathize with a mother in a dilemma 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 18 23:57:41 2018|7| According to the article they were women 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 18 23:56:40 2018|6|You need to see a therapist 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 18 23:16:38 2018|10|Where did I compare women to men Why are you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 18 21:44:04 2018|23|If housework is stressing you out so much that it s damaging your health hire help find a better partner or be single 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 18 20:11:54 2018|36|I mean if you post on a sub full of online feminist women you re going to get a different response than when polling people who don t necessarily subscribe to that form of extreme feminism 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 18 17:56:54 2018|59|I don t really do anything specific based on being a woman tbh I m aware of my surroundings and that s about it I d suggest that to everyone But I don t generally feel unsafe in public places just because of my gender Taking emotion out of it it wouldn t make sense for me to statistically 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 18 17:44:06 2018|5|No this is completely normal 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 21:09:52 2018|32|If you buy a vibrator and don t tell a bunch of strangers on the internet unnecessary information about your plans to masturbate is it still enjoyable You should test that theory 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 17:41:20 2018|25|That s odd You must not actually talk to them about children then because what you re saying is opposite of what child psychs suggest 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 17:38:17 2018|47|Seems like a fundamental disagreement if you think kids shouldn t be speaking out in age appropriate ways about not wanting to be touched But I ve got six years of professional experience to back up what I find appropriate so frankly your opinion is pretty irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 17:32:13 2018|12|Where does she say she screams at the top of her lungs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 17:30:46 2018|61|A three year old shouting that someone has to ask before touching them is not having a break down and screaming Three year olds are not yet capable of knowing the nuances between being assertive and just shouting things and it s much healthier for them to be encouraged to be clear about their feelings than tone policed at that age 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 17:19:11 2018|3|She s 3 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 15:46:28 2018|24|Yea I m fine with it and I don t think there is an statistical proof that it would have any effect on rape 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 15:26:26 2018|26|The big picture of women being able to make their informed decisions regardless of societal pressure Because your post and comments are the opposite of that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 15:20:08 2018|151|Just because you re upset that I called you out for your sexism and hypocrisy doesn t mean I haven t contributed Women don t need anyone telling them that they need to consider other people s opinions when they re making a decision on what is best for themselves and their families You even said in another comment that you re not facing any kind of discrimination at work from your boss yet you are insisting that women choosing not to go back to work somehow affects your ability to do so Your post reads as nothing but an attempt to shit on other women s choices and try to make yourself sound better further thinking ohhh I just don t think they re looking at the big picture because clearly I m the only one capable of doing that and making an informed decision and more successful than them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 15:06:45 2018|66|People take leave and decide not to come sometimes Not just pregnant people either That is temporarily inconvenient for a company If it is better for the person their family etc be it mentally financially whatever that s their choice to make No job is worth enduring if it s detrimental to someone s quality of life and sometime it takes time off to realize that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 14:59:59 2018|40|You mean what not to do right Because chasing downs thief is a nice way to get shot stabbed or otherwise harmed No one should encourage this No purse is worth that risk I m glad she ended up safe 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 14:53:48 2018|23|But apparently shaming women for their choices and acting sanctimonious about your own is the best one you can muster at this point 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 14:51:01 2018|23|Maybe you should find a better place to work if you think your job isn t going to last through your maternity leave 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 14:36:58 2018|28|You really don t have much respect for women and their ability to make choices but you re trying and failing to sound like you re being empathetic 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 14:35:06 2018|94|The idea that you put the onus on women to change their choices rather than the employers to change their perception is pretty messed up and sexist tbh It s not women s fault that some employers make assumptions about them as a whole rather than dealing with each case individually And frankly if I decide to be a stay at home mom after having a kid I would laugh in your face if you said something like this to me If it s best for my family and child I m doing it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 14:27:59 2018|37|No one needs those details I m dating a mother of two in her forties From my experience this guy is full of shit or something similar is plenty sufficient instead of giving people the intimate details 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 05:14:54 2018|1|TMI 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 01:31:38 2018|4|Not sure if trolling 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 00:45:36 2018|64|Yea I m sorry and I don t mean to invalidate anyone s experience but I really have a hard time believing that her rejecting advances really puts that much of a dent in her clientele I m sure it happens on occasion but if she has enough people not returning that it is affecting her earnings she might just be a bad barber 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 00:25:54 2018|72|I very rarely ran into anything beyond very benign flirting which I didn t reject It comes with the territory I have serious doubts 1 3 of anyone s clients try to fuck them That s an absolute exaggeration unless she genuinely thinks anyone who flirts is making advances I m good looking I ve worked with absolute stone cold foxes and it wasn t even a particularly common problem for them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 16 23:32:42 2018|6|Lol good What a delusional toolbox 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 16 22:54:41 2018|37|No no one needs a reminder People on the dog subreddit don t need to be reminded of feline AIDS either And people in breast cancer support groups don t need to be reminded of testicular cancer 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 16 22:33:17 2018|17|Yup How is that relevant to a sub about women s issues Oh yea it s not 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb 16 21:56:26 2018|43|Don t do anything You don t know their relationship dynamics My good friend is in a one sided open marriage because his wife is asexual and people try to rat him out to her every few months and just look like fools 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 23:55:43 2018|10|I m sorry that happened Mental illness is really sad 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 23:35:50 2018|21|I think the fact that the vast majority of mass shooters are white males does mean something What exactly is TBD 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 20:02:07 2018|8|Yes you can It s not your life 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 19:21:17 2018|8|I mean his comment implies that he does 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 18:52:58 2018|20|Plus even if she is exclusively breastfeeding shared custody is definitely an option during that time with pumping and all 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 18:02:11 2018|35|You do have 4 5 other current usernames floating around as well as 10 20 that have been banned here so perhaps you re thinking of a convo I ve had with one of those 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 17:55:40 2018|42|The only other discussion you and I have had that I recall is whether or not male victims should be included in discussions about sexual harassment yesterday and looking at that I don t see any rudeness or combativeness in either side 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 17:52:22 2018|14|Yes look at how rude and combative I am with my question Totally understandable 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 17:47:38 2018|20|You didn t answer my question What about his comment is woman hating It s an extremely pro choice sentiment 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 16:10:03 2018|15|What is he saying that is anti woman His outlook here is extremely pro choice 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 14:31:21 2018|30|So If people think abortion should be accessible for all women at any time those same people shouldn t be turning around and criticizing the reason anyone chooses to abort 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 05:08:47 2018|29|No I ve never felt pressured to do this stuff just because society wants me to I do it if I want and I don t do it otherwise 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 00:18:44 2018|35| metoo discussed things that already have happened It has not been around long enough or been studied enough to sho whether or not calling people out on things has an effect on conduct moving forward 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb 15 00:01:23 2018|16|I believe we are capable of it too It just isn t going to change things 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 23:29:42 2018|75|No I read your response It is asking something that I specifically addressed in my second paragraph This is not behavior that can effectively be adopted as an adult Both women and men need to be taught from childhood how to be productive members of society who are capable of interacting with one another and being assertive Classes and discussions as adults are just hypotheticals discussing what things would be like in a perfect world 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 22:26:56 2018|40|Yes the two can be separated Granted the majority in power are men but women in power have also been known to use their power in less than acceptable ways The tie that binds is their power not their gender 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 22:20:58 2018|15|The power dynamics are the exact problem not the gender of the people in power 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 22:20:04 2018|41|Did you read my second paragraph Because no if someone makes it to adulthood without understanding how to interact properly in a social setting it s not likely they re going to adequately learn how to do it as an adult 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 21:49:41 2018|60|But it s not just a woman s issue and it s one of things I don t feel can be discussed in s vacuum There are a lot of things that can but for victims of this sort of thing if we really are focusing on how to improve things we shouldn t be limiting it by restrictive language 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 21:47:46 2018|91|I mean the majority of people I know are capable of reading situations and gauging what is or isn t appropriate Because they learned how to do it as they grew and developed If someone is an adult and has no social tact or ability to gauge social situations there s not really a good way to make them suddenly know how to do it For the most part that bridge has been crossed and a little pamphlet of what is and isn t okay isn t going to do anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 21:43:58 2018|23|Or to other men I don t why you are against gender neutral language in this discussion That way no one feels alienated 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 20:49:22 2018|12|So then go out for drinks with coworkers in a casual setting 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 20:48:12 2018|91|I don t see why this is a bad thing A lot of companies have this policy and I m not sure why it would be necessary to drink at a work function anyway There s almost always at least one person who can t behave themselves after a few drinks and it s a big liability for a company if they were the ones that provided the booze No one is going to die because they didn t get to have a glass of wine at the company Christmas party 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 17:24:29 2018|2|Google hysterectomy 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 17:20:36 2018|36|Unless there is a legitimate medical problem it s very unlikely anyone would give you a hysterectomy Even with a health problem there are usually many options short of a hysterectomy that they would try first 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 17:17:21 2018|43|I don t agree with that I think it may be more beneficial to a LOT of people but I don t know if that warrants doing it Because I am not sure it will benefit more people than it won t benefit 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 17:09:16 2018|58|Yea I agree all of those things play varying parts too Point being it s not one specific thing but a whole lot of things that go into this issue And a complete overhaul of it will be hard to work out if it isn t done with some semblance of compassion which this administration seems to lack 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 15:51:45 2018|168|It s kinda funny because a bunch of people pay money every month to avoid picking out their own groceries At any rate I hate the dude for cutting 17 billion from the program That sucks regardless but I can actually see both sides of this issue To me it would come down to whether or not they cater to individual food allergies and what kind of food they re giving people If they end up with a box of food that is nutritionally balanced and have options for pick up in times when they move or can t get it delivered I think it s not a terrible idea Plus obesity epidemic in this country is out of hand and a lot of it comes down to underprivileged people being undereducated on nutrition and becoming malnourished This could potentially help remedy that too However considering how inhuman this administration seems to think poor people are I have doubts this will be something they actually use for good 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 06:58:18 2018|41|Someone posted about this a few days ago but I am not sure what his conduct in his band has to do with his ability to snowboard Sure I won t listen to his band But dude is a great snowboarder 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 03:59:28 2018|6|Then why is their weight relevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 02:00:12 2018|1|No
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 01:12:14 2018|9|Not unless it s somehow relevant which is rare 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 01:04:38 2018|29|I m guessing you mean your question to rhetorical but yea I have had that happen more than once I ve lived in the city since I was 21 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb 14 00:25:24 2018|23|I get that it s part of a bigger picture but I m tired of people complaining about such inconsequential and trivial crap 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 23:03:35 2018|8|Then why do you care what he says 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 23:01:25 2018|2|Eh no 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 22:44:11 2018|40|My job doesn t provide them but I don t think they should be obligated to The most I ask is if someone has an emergency regarding their period they should be allowed to run to the store if needed 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 20:19:30 2018|6|What if our fingers were snakes 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 17:57:00 2018|12|Can you show me that quote I seem to have missed it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 17:01:28 2018|24|Uh the article is about kids not being allowed to say no What about that comment implies that they didn t read the article 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 16:50:42 2018|16|Regardless of the genders the implications of not being allowed to say no are pretty bad 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 16:13:54 2018|26|Well children are required to say yes regardless of gender actually It s just more likely for the boy to ask the girl Stupid rule anyhow 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 15:06:50 2018|26|My period is a bro and doesn t generally come on things like holidays or vacation even if it s due I m like clockwork otherwise 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 14:26:50 2018|8|Are you buying them with your own money 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 04:07:44 2018|6|Nope I don t feel that 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 03:05:11 2018|25|She wasn t pregnant in the first place Stop suggesting people waste their money just because you don t understand how the female body works 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 01:58:50 2018|10|Waste of money when they had sex two weeks ago 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb 13 00:08:49 2018|37|The point is that telling your story to a site with unreliable and unprofessional writers tends to make people dubious of your claims A poorly written article by a hack doesn t reflect positively on anyone involved 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 23:52:01 2018|17|Babe net is such a garbage site with hack journalists looking to get exposure however they can 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 23:44:29 2018|15|Ah yes The Trump of the Philippines made a dumb comment I m so surprised 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 23:00:46 2018|16|I did offer respect and relevance Respect doesn t equal agreeing with everything a person says 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 22:49:59 2018|14|You d just like to see her more when your first choice is unavailable 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 22:49:00 2018|17|I didn t say anything about you I was relating to the person I was responding to 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 21:56:31 2018|59|My ex was a musician too After a while I got really used to having two separate routines based on whether or not he was home My SO now goes away for a week and is relieved that I say it s just a week because his ex would guilt him A week or two is like nothing really
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 21:08:34 2018|40|Just stay busy with your own stuff and you ll be okay I do have to say though If I had a friend who only made an effort to see me when their SO was gone I d feel used 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 16:05:38 2018|32|You mention trying to change your appearance but what have you done to be less boring You don t have to be physically attractive to make friends but you do need interests 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 06:15:11 2018|8|There is no way to test for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb 12 00:09:14 2018|23|Your doctor is not all doctors as it were Most explain what it is what it protects against why they suggest it etc 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 22:42:21 2018|37|No it s not literally the first thing the doctor tells someone about the shot And it s not super common for the soreness to last that long but it does sometimes happen Quit being a shit 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 19:37:00 2018|23|No but I do live in the actual real world and know that it doesn t revolve around you or how you look 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 17:35:39 2018|77|I think you should consider returning to therapy if you feel people are constantly targeting you I m not trying to be harsh but you re really not that important to others that the majority of people would go out of their way to harass you because you re ugly I m sure occasionally it will happen but the idea that it s a regular thing is something you ve taught yourself and it isn t reality 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 17:30:05 2018|36|I m willing to overlook something that has nothing to do with snowboarding If I listened to his music I d probably stop But that isn t relevant to why he s currently in the news 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 15:48:48 2018|8|Perfect question for a pharmacist and NOT REDDIT 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 15:42:39 2018|12|So they should change it because you can t control your temper 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 15:40:14 2018|15|You say it isn t location based and then use an example based on location 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 15:24:31 2018|3|Why would they 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 15:17:52 2018|22|That s pretty much every day for me If it isn t for you please consider leaving your situation and going elsewhere 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 15:16:37 2018|4|Yea that can happen 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 15:15:53 2018|31|My point is that I don t care what he did in his band It has nothing to do with his snowboarding and that s why he is being mentioned lately 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Feb 11 04:55:55 2018|16|I remember it but I don t think it has an effect on his snowboarding prowess 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 10 16:29:48 2018|12|Literally the first sentence of the post says her housing is free 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 22:40:40 2018|34| 53k is a livable wage is the majority of the US Hell I live in one of the most expensive cities in the US and that s what I make and I m fine 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 20:35:21 2018|11|Oh so your anecdote means more than mine somehow Got it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 20:25:08 2018|33|Maybe for six figures but the idea that art majors can t make a living is wrong Y all just don t seem to grasp the various possibilities of art degrees beyond painting 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 20:10:23 2018|4|Probably Coco most recently 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 19:54:19 2018|12|I know a whole lot of art majors who make six digits 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 19:52:55 2018|10|Wow using two usernames in the same thread Bold move 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 15:02:41 2018|2|Eye roll
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 06:04:46 2018|34|Memes are on trollxchromosomes I wouldn t suggest that place though It started as people jokingly being over the top radfems but now it s just actually a bunch of over the top radfems 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 05:17:46 2018|25|You probably have a face that looks upset when it s neutral Count your blessings that something so benign is a notable problem for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 05:01:04 2018|25|I dunno If my coworker looks upset I usually try to find out what s wrong and offer empathy Because I m a human being 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 04:53:09 2018|30|Funny how you say that yet you deleted the comment where you pretty much said the doctor does the same thing you can do at home so it s cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 04:25:43 2018|29|No shit But they are professionals with experience and dilators other equipment if needed to assist them in removing it safely Removing it at home can cause terrible damage 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Feb  9 04:22:03 2018|16|For anyone reading this please do not remove your IUD at home Go to a doctor 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 22:05:12 2018|19|Yea I mean who has two seconds to google something before forming a negative and misinformed opinion about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 21:50:02 2018|26|You know that s the point of the song right It s poking at the persona the singer felt he had when the band started out 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 14:31:04 2018|32|Yes but the article is discussing countries where girls don t receive education and why it would make better economic sense for them to get it But alllivesmatter and all that Yea 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 14:29:31 2018|12|Did you try reading the article or were the words too big 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 05:18:10 2018|35|And even if you were using it as a prefix to critic it doesn t work in your description Unless you were trying to say this sub less critical than others Which you weren t 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 05:15:15 2018|27|Wow you re really going to great lengths of bullshit in order to not admit that you re wrong It s fucking Reddit dude get a grip 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 04:46:10 2018|11|Go ahead and show me the dictionary entry for hypo critic 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 04:42:01 2018|7|Silly Merriam Webster What do they know 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 04:26:44 2018|12|The word hypo critic is not a word in the English language 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 04:25:01 2018|20|Yes I supposed if you make up a fake word you can claim it applies to any situation you choose 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 04:23:05 2018|14|Is the dog subreddit considered segregated because it doesn t promote the cat subreddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 04:19:37 2018|8|Also the word is hypocritical not hypo critic 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Feb  8 04:18:54 2018|2| r oneychromosome
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 23:12:30 2018|10|That s a terrible thing to do to a person 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 22:36:54 2018|1|27
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 20:32:35 2018|34|Children are starving in all sorts of places Not just war torn countries There is poverty in most countries including the US Your mental gymnastics to continue blaming everything on men is really unsettling 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 18:33:28 2018|11|I think starving children is the worst problem in the world 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 14:09:35 2018|26|Taking completely innocuous behavior as threatening assuming the worst in a situation and obsessing about it til it makes you feel sick is not being cautious 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 14:01:04 2018|53|No I m not This is genuinely daft thinking Absolutely nothing you described supports the idea that he was following you I would honestly assume this was a fake post but I ve seen too many genuinely paranoid people to jump to that Please see a professional This is no way to live 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 13:37:21 2018|35|So he walked in the same direction as you at a park stopped to check his phone and then went elsewhere I wouldn t call having this kind of paranoia lucky I d suggest therapy 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 06:36:57 2018|11|He told you that you hav to sleep on the couch 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 02:02:19 2018|5|This sub is for discussion 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 01:55:16 2018|5|Right I m asking why 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 01:48:15 2018|16|What s wrong with Daddy Daughter dances Why are they grouped in with creepy purity balls 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 01:44:59 2018|22|I want to have the same name as my future kid and I don t like hyphenated stuffso the choice was easy 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 01:41:28 2018|36|I don t see a problem with it Fathers if present and involved have a big influence on how their daughters view men and what their daughters end up accepting or tolerating in a romantic relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 00:16:30 2018|29|Why don t you just tell him you re not interested He s not really doing anything but showing interest so it s pretty unfair to call him creepy 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Feb  7 00:11:48 2018|50|I mean most of what women complain about is in relation to PMS You don t hear anyone complain about bloating headaches acne or the desire to eat everything in sight That seems hard to believe I hardly even hang out with women and I hear it all the time 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 23:48:01 2018|14|Uh Right Pretty sure it s widely acknowledged That s what PMS stands for 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 23:23:48 2018|19|You should read the information about a medication before you take it It s not included just for funsies 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 22:40:18 2018|10|That depends on your daughter her interests and her personality 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 22:38:20 2018|12|So take a hint that it s not relevant to this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 21:50:48 2018|6|Why are you still with him 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 19:43:19 2018|16|It is like memory foam but your friend obviously doesn t understand how memory foam works 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 16:22:29 2018|26|I dunno if I d consider what they are discussing to be eugenics They re talking about nurture not actually alternating or breeding for specific genes 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 03:57:31 2018|19|I don t need to assume much when you literally just asked if you should lie to your partner 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 03:47:48 2018|26|The fact that you are considering deceiving your future fianc e means your marriage isn t going to last anyway so it really doesn t matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 02:29:03 2018|9|Ma am is the northern version of ma am 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 01:56:35 2018|9|Yea you are definitely showing how mature you are 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 01:44:09 2018|30|Hey I ve said my piece When you re alone at 40 because no one wants to put up with your inability to be an adult don t be surprised 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 01:33:09 2018|168| Of course I enable my mother I can enable her or go full no contact Or you can be your own person and put the ball in her court as to whether she can accept that or not If he wants to leave because he doesn t understand that families are complicated then he s not mature enough to be a good partner If he wants to leave because you continually choose your mother s preferences over his he isn t the one that is too immature to be a good partner You re 32 frickin years old If you plan on being in a lasting relationship with anyone you need to grow the eff up and stand up to your mother Prioritizing her feelings over your partner s will get old eventually and he will be gone But go right ahead and keep telling yourself that it s his maturity that is the problem instead of looking the mirror and facing your own inadequacy as a partner 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 01:11:08 2018|111| wow you take way too much stock in a person s username Do you also think I m two dogs You enable your mother That s why she continues Show her that you are an independently functioning adult and eventually she will treat you like one Or you could continue pandering to her and eventually lose your boyfriend when he gets fed up with the bullshit Which he will Then you won t have to tell your parents he lives with you because he won t be He is communicating that there is a problem and you are doing nothing to solve it Grow up and be a 32 year old 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 00:54:02 2018|8|I don t even know what that means 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Feb  6 00:48:22 2018|14|Your boyfriend is right You need to suck it up and be an adult 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb  5 21:40:45 2018|12|I think if anything it was rude toward UPS guys not women 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb  5 21:14:08 2018|32|I dunno Everyone has different thresholds So it s not easy to tell if someone is over reacting I d have chuckled and moved on with my day You re more sensitive 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb  5 17:41:22 2018|28|Not your problem If she can t respect that other people have different ways of dealing with things that s an issue she needs to address with herself 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb  5 17:03:09 2018|25|Treat him like you do any other friend If he can t use his words to tell you he s interested nothing will happen anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Feb  5 16:52:02 2018|36|Your relationship and how you define things within it are between you and your boyfriend Tell her you appreciate her concern but that it s not really any of her business unless you ask her help 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 13:12:44 2018|13|Yea my posting history of almost exclusively twoX and askwomen definitely implies that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 13:09:17 2018|29|I m not the person who sexually harassed a service worker and then tried to harbor sympathy that he didn t like it because I m ugly and fat 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 13:05:39 2018|12|I don t care where they post They re right about this 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 13:01:38 2018|43|You are just making yourself look bad here You know how in OP you said you felt gross You should What you did was disgusting and the fact that you are trying to play the victim when you sexually harassed someone is repulsive 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 12:43:19 2018|11|Why making women validate their choices as feminist is not feminist 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 12:39:03 2018|4|You yelled at him 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 02:06:46 2018|15|She s a victim of sexual abuse blackmail and manipulation from a really young age 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 01:58:35 2018|4|Go to the doc
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 31 00:23:29 2018|13|Marriage or not if you have a kid with someone you will bicker 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 23:23:18 2018|8|Still the same comment Let them handle it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 23:09:10 2018|14|Unless you re Adam Sarah or Jessica I am not sure why you care

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 22:38:08 2018|13|Headline Strawberries Cure Cancerbrought to you by the National Council for Strawberry Farmers
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 18:42:15 2018|40|Right but there aren t any medications I m aware of that someone can be on indefinitely without getting a check up Docs require a yearly exam to ensure that the medication is still appropriate for the person taking it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 18:32:55 2018|105|Docs like to not be sued If there is an issue going on with the patient that goes unnoticed because of a lack of physical exam the doc is leaving themselves wide open to a lawsuit regardless of whether it was the patient who insisted on no physical exam or not But really none of this is all that relevant to OP s issue because she isn t in the US and I don t know Canadian laws I am only in the medical field in the US and can speak from experience there Probably not worth it to derail OP s post even more 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 18:27:12 2018|11|Usually they require one before prescribing it much like other medications 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 18:19:39 2018|27|Not necessarily a pap but a physical exam To make sure there are no obvious health issues that have gone unnoticed could cause problems with the BC 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 17:49:49 2018|11|It says in the title that there are photos and blood 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 17:42:05 2018|19|Yea who would think that pictures of the aftermath of being smashed with a bottle would show something NSFW 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 17:39:14 2018|19|The post s wording seems to imply there is some kind of correlation between the two beyond random chance 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 17:37:52 2018|18|I got smashed with a bottle in 09 for saying no to a guy who asked me out 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 17:27:20 2018|8|So actually nothing to do with the moon 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 16:24:00 2018|32|I mean they re college kids You d be hard pressed to find one that doesn t have the occasional knee jerk reaction It wasn t overboard They can talk it through 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 16:21:38 2018|11|What does the blue moon have to do with your period 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 15:00:44 2018|12|You re projecting your problems onto her relationship based on a paragraph 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 14:59:16 2018|9|Saying he was uncomfortable falls under addressing it no 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 14:34:12 2018|4|You must be new 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 30 14:32:58 2018|17|Or like have a discussion with him about it where you both clearly explain how you feel 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 18:31:11 2018|27|No I m not going to dignify you with any information after you accused me of being a man who hates women and thinks they re evil 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 18:15:36 2018|49|Because I worked in a private clinic that provided the same services as PP for a year and a half Y all go around talking big game about how stuff never or always happens You don t even know the first thing about what goes on in a clinic 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 17:47:28 2018|57|Those aren t the only circumstances That s what y all keep repeating but there are circumstances beyond that where there is absolutely no reason why the baby can t be born alive as opposed to dead It s not common but it does happen and there need to be restrictions put in place for those circumstances 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 17:31:00 2018|5|I m not a man 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 17:25:33 2018|64|If the fetus has an abnormally high chance of killing her and it s healthy itself I don t see a reason why they d need to kill it before removing it At that gestation she is going to be giving birth either way If the fetus itself has the health problem then yes I can see why it would need to be aborted 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 17:12:48 2018|16|She s the resident caricature of an actual feminist so she s an expert on everything 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 17:10:20 2018|18|Yea you made that clear but arguing with me isn t going to change my mind so shrug 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 16:49:05 2018|60|I am fine with restricting women s rights when it comes to a healthy late pregnancy I think abortion should be openly available to women for any reason up til a certain point After that point I think it Should be restricted I can t agree with the idea that it should be available for any reason at any time 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 16:37:21 2018|40|Most of the time that is true but there are people fighting for the ability to abort for any reason at any time and at that point I think it should be illegal to do for any reason besides health 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 16:29:21 2018|25|At 35 weeks there is no reason to kill the fetus instead of putting it up for adoption She has to give birth either way 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 15:07:11 2018|27|Why the fuck do you hate your child sister for being taken advantage of by adult men You re in your thirties Where is your common sense 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 04:43:17 2018|30|I mean Yes they do Both my spouse and I are provided paid leave in the case of injury and my previous employer also provided that Sorry your job sucks 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 29 00:10:45 2018|39|The idea that childfree people are widely and regularly harassed wherever they turn is just a problem made up by a bunch of privileged people who have to manufacture oppression since they don t actually face any real problems 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 28 21:35:50 2018|15|And for lady exes you can change dick to clit Or is that suddenly sexist

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 28 20:18:09 2018|5|They gave everyone extra time 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 28 20:13:46 2018|7|It flies in plenty of other countries 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 28 19:42:33 2018|13|Parental leave with a little extra for women recovering from giving birth IMO 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 28 17:29:24 2018|79| I already did and the physician told me that what happened was just basically because of emotions bottled upEither you didn t listen to what they actually said because you are so stuck on there not being anything wrong with you or you didn t see a mental health professional The term physician makes me think it s the latter but I suspect it is also the former Stop making excuses for being a danger to yourself and others 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 28 17:19:46 2018|31|I think you need to go find professional help Can you honestly read this from an outside perspective and think you sound like a person anyone would want to stay with 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 28 00:10:01 2018|62|Most people require certain things to be happy However much they require to be content makes them either high maintenance or low maintenance If they are in a relationship they sometimes look to their partner to provide them with some of those things Thus their partner may consider them high or low maintenance Is that simple enough or are you still confused 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 27 23:34:58 2018|18|I think it s only an ugly saying if you personally think one is worse than the other 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 27 23:32:42 2018|6|Guess you gotta get out more 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 27 23:29:38 2018|22|Yes it is Some people have more wants and needs in order to maintain a relationship with them and some have fewer 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 27 23:26:19 2018|8|High low maintenance is a personality trait though 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 27 23:25:21 2018|16|Pixie cuts aren t low maintenance They need to be cut often to keep their shape 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 27 23:14:58 2018|63|I think it would have been more realistic if it featured a woman being assaulted by someone she already knew as the vast majority of often unreported sexual assaults are by acquaintances friends or boyfriends not strangers on the subway Stranger Danger is vastly exaggerated Other than that it s a lot better made and acted than anything I saw in high school 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 27 19:15:41 2018|60|No one gives a fuck about your mental gymnastics in an attempt to deflect the fact that you are somehow incapable of being a normal human being with control of where you put your eyes Maybe you should see a doctor Women have been breast feeding literally for th entire history of humans Don t blame your depravity on society

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 27 00:10:08 2018|31|The question asked about our personal preference or the way we go about consent So I am answering about my personal preference and the way I go about consent Imagine that

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 26 23:25:54 2018|23|Nah I ve been able to communicate what I am and am not okay with doing in every sexual encounter I ve had 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 26 22:54:10 2018|7|That is a good realization to make

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 26 20:10:30 2018|24|No I don t like being explicitly asked for consent Ruins the mood I can use my words if I m not into it

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 26 04:37:07 2018|34|I definitely understand caring for your child absolutely But words shouted from a car aren t going to harm your kid and you re a much better mother out of jail I m sure 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 26 04:33:57 2018|7|Yea that s definitely what I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 26 03:51:20 2018|29|Even if that is the case I don t think we should be living in a world where a kid will get beaten to unconsciousness for saying something idiotic 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 26 03:47:24 2018|40|It sounds more like he wanted to fuck you but I guess that s open to interpretation At any rate I don t think wishing horrific acts of violence on a person for being an idiot is really that great 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 26 03:41:24 2018|12|Sooooo you re low key telling someone they should be beaten unconscious 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 22:11:07 2018|16|Pretty sure my first comment said almost exactly that anyway you have a nice day too 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 22:00:35 2018|145| Congrats for being an asshole Thanks 3 Take a minute to read if you can and see this guy is looking for professional help I read that she will be seeing a doctor It says so in the OP His daughters health is deteriorating before his eyes and he s seeking some information from others who may have gone through this So then he can seek out an ED support group But even then it s not going to give him his daughter s perspective I d argue it s more detrimental to her for him to go into things with the perspectives of others rather than just listening to what she has to say He ll have preconceived notions based on the opinions of other people Like I get that his intentions were good but that doesn t magically make this a good idea 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 21:14:48 2018|6|Well that s not very nice 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 21:04:58 2018|14|Yea But I am entitled to my opinion really pushed it over the edge 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 20:52:35 2018|13|Oh I guess I don t care if it comes off as rude 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 20:11:25 2018|76|I understand that Women aren t a monolith and half the people here who claim to be women aren t even women Talk to your daughter Talk to professionals Getting input from a bunch of maybe women about their feelings on something you can t even verify they have experienced is a shitty way to go about things How some random woman in Arkansas feels is not relevant to what your daughter thinks feels or experiences 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 20:02:41 2018|19|Asking random unqualified people for their opinions regarding your daughter s serious medical condition is stupid Straight up Sorrynotsorry 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 19:56:03 2018|58| As I mentioned in my post we are seeking the help of professionals and will continue to do so Yea I read that This still isn t something to come to reddit for I honestly question your common sense if you think this is an appropriate thing to go to a bunch of randos on the internet about 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 19:49:47 2018|17|This is absolutely not something to come to reddit for Speak with professionals and take THEIR advice 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 19:41:30 2018|4| Courtland Skye sUnnecessary apostrophe 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 19:13:28 2018|16|You aren t replying to people s comments You re writing a bunch of parent comments 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 18:20:00 2018|21|That just isn t true People with age differences get criticism regardless of whether the man or the woman is older 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 18:00:50 2018|31| Men date younger women all the time and no one bats an eye I wouldn t say that A lot of people bat eyes about the older man younger woman thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 17:35:31 2018|13|Why do you think anyone cares what some random dillweed posts on fb 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 17:32:53 2018|46| Most guys would tell him to Fuck off So grow some balls and tell him that you won t be treated that way anymore Or find a new job Pretty sure if she tells him to fuck off she will need to find a new job 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 16:54:11 2018|15|Koreans have a different work ethic than Americans and their culture is still pretty patriarchal 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 07:24:37 2018|36|AFAIK they still are still working on the case and I don t think he s currently doing standup And I m pretty sure he drugged and raped women not girls Were any of them underage 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 07:13:06 2018|7|He should be in prison too yea 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 05:55:29 2018|7|CampusReform is know to be extremely biased 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 05:45:44 2018|67|I am not googling anything If you are going to make the claim that this event happened the way you say it did and that the decision was made because of feminism the burden lies on you to prove it As it stands you just sound like a bitter dude who wants to blame the women s movement for everything because no one will touch your peepee 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 05:33:54 2018|17|So she wrote a feminist paper 22 years ago Very rock solid proof that is a misandrist 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 05:21:48 2018|9|So when did the administrators identify themselves as feminists 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 04:20:01 2018|2|Good point 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 03:12:59 2018|12|Good I wish he could get the death penalty Piece of shit 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 25 01:33:40 2018|3|You re fine 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 24 17:24:49 2018|24|I dunno if it fares well for either gender if villains are always make but female characters are usually sidekicks Seems like a wash 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 24 15:54:37 2018|20|I did not read that incredibly lengthy wall of text but it has only been a month Just move on 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 24 02:36:10 2018|1|Okay
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 23 22:34:07 2018|80| no one s getting a benefit What isn t beneficial about having more time to complete an exam People should be concerned about what they are getting on an exam not what other people are getting If someone knows the right answers and it just happens to take them longer to get to them that doesn t make them any less capable Some people are just not great at testing Luckily the real world doesn t involve much standardized testing 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 23 22:23:16 2018|35|If 1 2 of the population has difficulty with something it needs to be re examined But I m not sure why you re making a fuss about it when men get the same benefit 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 23 22:19:21 2018|25|But men get extended time too So if the regular time is generally fine for men wouldn t even more time be even more beneficial 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 23 21:02:59 2018|19|I m for gender equality but against the march Or at least completely uninterested in being involved in it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 23 20:50:12 2018|24|Odd I ve had women as me this way more than men I just say i dunno not really on my agenda right now 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 23 19:59:45 2018|8|They gave everyone more time not just women 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 23 06:08:30 2018|5|Have you tried not looking 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 23 02:48:24 2018|1|No 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 22 22:19:12 2018|1| notallwhitewomen
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 22 15:09:22 2018|29|Or not If you make a mess clean it up Two year olds know that I think adult women should strive to be more responsible than two year olds 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan 22 07:06:09 2018|71|I mean she s right White women still voted for Roy Moore WOC didn t A large percentage of white women voted for Trump WOC didn t White women s complacence toward the presidential election is one of the reasons he got elected in the first place They only give a shit now because they re feeling the effects They didn t care before WOC have felt the effects for decades 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 21 06:28:52 2018|6|Is she going to press charges 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 21 02:05:17 2018|1|Yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 21 01:31:23 2018|36|Why would I choose a PCP for my kid if they re only go into want to change to a new one when they become a teenager I d prefer they stay with the same one 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 21 01:30:20 2018|18|So then share something that happened to shave women rather than something that isn t about the US 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 21 01:29:19 2018|22| yes You are saying something that is factually incorrect It is important to realize that what you just said isn t true 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 21 00:12:13 2018|62|Why is choosing a doctor of the same sex telling your kid to only trust that particular doctor The vast majority of teen girls and adult women actually are going to feel more comfortable talking to a woman about their periods That doesn t mean they mistrust men It means they feel more comfortable speaking with a person who understands their experience 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 20 18:21:16 2018|4|It s not accurate 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 20 18:16:25 2018|48|As I said a lot of them are only involved because they are directly affected by it Once they aren t they ll be gone again I don t have to make assumptions about things There are statistics from the election that show exactly why Trump became president 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 20 17:33:12 2018|40|She should vote That s the only thing I can think of and it s what matters the most And it s doing more than a large portion of the women who are marching today did before trump was elected 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 20 17:20:19 2018|12|I don t think Louisiana was part of the in the 1760s 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 20 17:19:21 2018|13|I donate time and money to charities and causes that help those women 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 20 16:36:07 2018|88|My city s march is today and I refuse to go Too many of the women who are so gung ho about this march we re complacent about things like voting until Trump got elected and they started being directly affected by the shittiness And once he s out of office and or their lives are no longer inconvenienced they ll go back to their lives and forget about the women who struggled before and continue to struggle I refuse to align with people who are fairweather feminists 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 20 01:58:27 2018|1|Why 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 20 00:22:41 2018|2| what would 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 23:44:02 2018|6|Sounds like a mentally ill person 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 23:03:55 2018|44|I would generally get my kid a provider who is the same sex or gender as my child As a baby it doesn t matter but as they get older I d want them to stay comfortable with the person giving them medical care 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 22:32:22 2018|21|They do Then she gets banned and just hops on a new username It s almost comical but moreover just sad 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 22:29:39 2018|65|It s just because SemperFemenina aka 30 other usernames reports everything she disagrees with and the mods don t have time to read and see whether it s trolling or not She uses a bunch of usernames to report so it ends up in their queue a bunch I d imagine and makes it seem as though a lot of people are upset over it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 20:12:28 2018|13|Does she already know how to spell Because this could be really confusing 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 20:43:28 2018|21|I m not saying it s not cute but it can be confusing for a kid when things are intentionally misspelled 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 20:49:22 2018|54|It strikes me as something a parent would put up to get attention and back pats from other adults not anything that is done for the sake of the kiddo I don t see any reason why someone would choose to intentionally confuse their kid with a meme they have no concept of otherwise 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 18:52:45 2018|6|Maybe you can use your words 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 18:41:16 2018|22|Not everyone shows emotion in the same way so what one person perceived as sympathy may fly under the radar for another 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 18:11:24 2018|29|You can t really go into something expecting a specific reaction because you will always end up disappointed People deal with troubling news in a lot of different ways 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 19 14:27:59 2018|20|There are ways of doing that without sucking the passion and ease out of a situation and turning it robotic 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 22:30:39 2018|8|It applies to a large portion of men 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 22:23:22 2018|3|It does tho 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 22:17:47 2018|46|Yes if it applied to a large section of women but not me I would understand that the person saying it was no referring to me but to those women Because I m not an idiot and I don t need to make everything about me 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 22:09:51 2018|16|Here is a thought If a comment about men doesn t apply to you ignore it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 19:58:02 2018|6|Tell him you aren t interested 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 19:44:08 2018|125|Wow what a terrible bullshit article I ll be editing this comment with quotes from it as I go through pro life women want to eradicate the taking of the life that sex creates and to restore respect for the links that sex naturally has with gorgeous things like love commitment marriage kin and future Yes you need to emphasize consent but you should also demand that sex be as beautiful and affirming as women want and deserve What if we don t want it to be beautiful and affirming and we just want to have sex ETA No I m not going to go through it afterall I d have to quote the whole article which is a bunch of sanctimonious pro life garbage 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 18:52:57 2018|20|Most yea but it is a topic that comes up when discussing abortion so I think it s worth mentioning 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 18:29:22 2018|84|For myself yea There are only certain situations I would deem it appropriate for me to abort For others generally no Their choice Though I may disagree with them The only caveat I can think of is if they are very far along in a healthy pregnancy I think at that point the fetus shouldn t be killed just parental rights waived and put up for adoption They have to give birth either way so I don t see a reason to kill it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 05:30:23 2018|17|Maybe you could read the 747386748 other posts on this instead of starting a new one Maybe 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 00:24:39 2018|36|Lord knows I am just a terrified little mouse with no ability to tell someone what I do and don t want I need this questionnaire It is not like I m a free thinking adult 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 18 00:08:21 2018|107|Yea that is definitely good I think male feminists are important because you generally don t get radicalized since at some point that ends of being self hatred You are a good moderate force that keeps things level in a time when some of the loudest feminists simply want to call misogyny on everyone who doesn t see things in black and white I wanted to also add pay special attention to the stories and struggles of women of color White women have a loud of voice in third wave feminism and it often drowns out the voices of those who experience more severe forms of oppression 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 23:50:22 2018|129|Ignore the people who say bullshit like that to you They don t speak on behalf of all women and cause more harm to the public image of the movement than helping it move forward Listen to what women around you are saying about their own experiences You don t need to provide input just listen Be supportive and use your voice if you happen to see a woman being treated unfairly based on her sex but I mean do that when you see anyone being treated unfairly really You don t need to be a hero for women We are perfectly capable of being our own heroes Just exist and don t do shitty things and you ll be better than a large section of the population already 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 19:50:49 2018|26|I m not sure what you re looking for here You have two choices Either report him to HR or don t report him to HR 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 19:46:43 2018|16|That s exactly what HR is for And no they cannot tell him it was you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 19:43:08 2018|37|If he hasn t done or said anything I m not sure what you re expecting You ask if you re overreacting but I don t see you reacting at all so keep not reacting I guess 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 19:21:59 2018|40|So he says this particular thing regularly That would IMO y that he finds it to be a normal thing to say That doesn t answer my question though What else has he done that you feel has been inappropriate 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 19:14:07 2018|14|What else has he done did he do that you would interpret as inappropriate 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 17:21:25 2018|26|Yea people feel fat sometimes But not everyone is so self involved that they make an exciting family trip into an issue because they feel fat 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 17:18:46 2018|109|Be open and honest with her Tell her this is a trip you are really looking forward to and it s about being with family It s not about her No one is going to be concentrating on how she looks Shes being selfish and self absorbed don t tell her this though Her feelings should be minimized If it was your wedding or something I could see her concern but if she s upset about her weight she can put on a cover up and deal with it Maybe she ll remember how she feels right now and focus on eating well and exercising more in the future 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 16:55:32 2018|16|BV is bacterial and yeast is Yeast Completely possible for them exist at the same time 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 16:54:41 2018|69|It s from the 1950s I think Somewhere around there Appreciate it for what it was at the time it was made rather than looking at it through the eyes of today I love the show Friends but it is sexist and homophobic in a lot of its jokes Still love the show Just acknowledge that it would be problematic now and enjoy it for what it was then 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 16:12:53 2018|20|They ll run back into their caves the minute the oppression isn t directly affecting them anymore anyway so Shrug 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 16:10:58 2018|20|Or they could hold a sign that says I only care about oppression when it s happening directly to me 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 16:01:43 2018|52|A lot of the women at the march should hold a sign that says something akin to I was complacent until after Donald Trump got elected in fact I didn t even vote in the election lol but now I m going to pretend like I ve been an activist all along 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 17 15:58:57 2018|28|OH great now that they broke the AA news we will have to read articles from this terrible site all the time They got exactly what they wanted 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 22:43:26 2018|27|There s like four posts about it every hour so I don t think quiet is the word to use I m tired of hearing about frankly 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 20:07:25 2018|17|No one should stay angry That s no way to live Stay strong and assertive not angry 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 19:06:02 2018|29|I think there are enough threads about this on this sub and all over reddit where you can read about what people think Why start a whole new post 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 19:49:05 2018|3|I dunno 12 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 16:48:04 2018|13|Oh yea I don t think he is guilty of a crime either 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 16:15:29 2018|43|They are both the bad date in this story As I said there were missteps by both but if you re interested in reading my perspective more you can look at my comment history I feel like I m repeating myself a lot 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 16:03:13 2018|16|I know how to quote I am just too lazy to do it in my phone 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 16:02:41 2018|128|It undermines the concept of women having agency in sexual encounters by constantly playing women as victims with no ability draw boundaries Being unclear about boundaries for 20 minutes before finally putting your foot down and saying hey I m not into it doesn t make all of the previous events sexual assault It makes them a bad date Women aren t wilting little flowers who can t make their feelings known The constant narrative that we are too afraid to speak up undermines us as adults who can control a situation and puts all the power on men There are times when fear will play a factor but showing it as an overarching trend in any interaction with a man does nothing but make us look weaker 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 15:46:24 2018|73|I dunno do you understand what words mean Because I m pretty sure my comment had words in it that clarified exactly how I feel Here I can say it again That s what gets me I m tired of fighting to prove that women are free thinking people who can make their own decisions and survive independently when a large sub section of feminists undermine the concept whenever talking about sexual encounters 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 15:45:27 2018|15|I will repeat Can you show me where I said his behavior was not problematic 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 15:44:19 2018|57|I think that was good to do But that doesn t negate the numerous times she expected him to be a mind reader We need to be direct about what we do and don t want Just because it took her 20 30 minutes to do so doesn t mean that the previous events constituted sexual assault 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 15:42:03 2018|13|Why do you keep quoting stupid and indecisive as though I said it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 15:40:37 2018|12|Can you show me where I said his behavior was not problematic 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 15:34:34 2018|17|I don t think feminism is completely counterproductive I think it has its share of problems though 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 15:33:53 2018|19|I read the original article not the NYT article so my opinion was formed based on the original article 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 15:26:33 2018|40|Your third paragraph sorry in my phone so can t quote it I absolutely agree with But I think there were missteps on both sides of this thing so either both are victims or neither are and I choose neither 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 14:50:37 2018|42|A lot of people here have a very interesting interpretation of what anti female is though Disagreeing with a woman or some aspect of feminism doesn t automatically make someone a misogynist but there are people here who are quick to accuse 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 14:49:27 2018|8|Youre talking to someone who does exactly that 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 14:26:03 2018|40|I dunno if I d say he s a victim but I wouldn t say she is one either I also think the site that picked up her story is who is actually pushing to define it as sexual assault 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 14:23:47 2018|11|I think they are She s known to have many accounts 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 13:24:46 2018|115|I mean I m not going on the runaround with you I know who you are and I know that you literally do nothing all day but sit here picking fights with people you disagree with We are not going to agree and it s not because I hate women there is no point in going back and forth endlessly I m sure you ll have a new username soon I mean braided bread only lasted like a day I have to hand it to you that you re able to come up with 20 30 new usernames in a year though Maybe you could use that creativity toward something that actually matters Take care 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 13:19:15 2018|76|They sure can but I don t I love other women I just don t like when other women perpetuate the idea that we have no agency or ability to make our own decisions and say things that imply that men are the only one who can be held accountable for their actions Women are smarter and stronger than that and it s sad that a large subset of us seem to think we aren t 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 12:52:44 2018|101|I don t buy the power imbalance thing If that s the case how can someone in a position of power ever effectively get consent The two agreed to go on a date and did date things It wasn t any different than any other date between two people If she was his subordinate or could somehow be professionally affected by saying no I would agree with you but that s not the case here She went on a bad date where a guy acted boorish She called him out and he apologized That should have been the end of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 12:09:58 2018|16|Okay I m a woman and I posted my perspective on here I agree with him 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 12:07:54 2018|42|That s what gets me I m tired of fighting to prove that women are free thinking people who can make their own decisions and survive independently when a large sub section of feminists undermine the concept whenever talking about sexual encounters

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 07:33:45 2018|32|It s beyond me that she decided to just take someone s word for it when they said they re clean and then get mad when that turns out to be wrong 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan 16 07:32:13 2018|17|You didn t make him get tested before having sex so no your anger isn t warranted

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 14 13:11:12 2018|16|Does everything need to be explicitly described as satire for people to understand that it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 14 12:48:14 2018|6|To no extent is the answer 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 14 11:52:46 2018|14|If that s what you believed why did you post and ask a question 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 14 07:06:55 2018|14|Let people live their lives If they want help and seek help help them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 14 05:17:53 2018|45|That sounds like a projection OP says numerous times that no one wants to rude and stop her It s not rude to tell someone that you want to focus on the task at hand It s not her fault no one is doing that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 14 05:05:42 2018|67|There are plenty of ways to let her know that you all want to concentrate on your project rather than talk It s not her fault that no one is drawing boundaries with her She isn t a mind reader If people listen and continue responding to everything she says there is no reason why she should know that you don t want to talk to her 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan 14 04:50:54 2018|30|She s paying to be there too She can talk about what she wants If you all don t want to hear it don t engage in conversation with her 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 22:33:24 2018|43|I d feel fine about it I don t need to be involved 100 in every aspect of my SO s life We kind of both do have limitations on what we can share from our jobs anyway Hasn t been a problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:57:07 2018|86|She does say in the beginning that it s just her personal preference as far as her marriages went and they she doesn t think any less of people People who have vast cultural differences often do run into these problems when they try to be together so I don t think there s anything wrong with decide she doesn t want to do that again The topic of making vlogs about every random thin under the sun is a whole other can of worms though 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:48:57 2018|7|Depends on the boundaries of your relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:42:51 2018|29|They re all just different kinds of crazy and she is conditioned from birth to be accustomed to Russian crazy and not Korean crazy So Korean crazy seems crazier 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:31:45 2018|18|No it doesn t It s either cheating or it s not cheating F this micro cheating stuff 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:25:30 2018|20|Yikes What did she say in the video that makes it seem like she dislikes the culture as a whole 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:19:59 2018|27|Ethnicity the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition The person you are talking about is Australian 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:17:51 2018|40|I didn t watch the whole 20 minute video so I don t know if she said anything racist I just don t know why a Russian woman preferring her marriage to a Russian man is all that shocking though 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:15:04 2018|5|Which directly correlate with ethnicity 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:11:09 2018|27|I didn t listen to her drone on for 23 minutes but ethnicity culture plays a really big role in a lot of things pertaining to relationships 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 18:07:00 2018|15|White woman prefers marriage to man of same culture as she is News at 11 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 17:47:18 2018|81|I saw a list of micro cheating a couple years ago and it basically included everything that would qualify as being a person s friend Essentially it implies that being friends with someone of sex you re interested in was micro cheating Like He texts a girl Happy Birthday and adds unnecessary extra compliments or says he s thinking about her People cheat or they don t cheat This microcheating thing is dumb and just another way to make people paranoid 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 07:32:47 2018|1|Hourglass 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 07:08:17 2018|10|Guess you ll never know then Reading sure is hard 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 07:02:36 2018|36|Why don t you read the comments I ve made literally right in this thread You replied to my comment pretty far down in the thread yet you didn t bother to read what I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 06:55:32 2018|26|The other person and I are talking about whether trans women should post here or not I have no idea what you re going on about 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 06:41:03 2018|1|No 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 06:37:22 2018|37|A public website is not a safe space for anyone And this sub specifically welcomes all women Go hang out on r gendercritical or some bullshit TERF sub if trans women offend your delicate sensibilities so much 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 06:33:11 2018|14|Women are women are women Trans women are not the problem in this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 06:29:53 2018|2|Fuck that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 06:12:17 2018|3|Yea it can 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan 13 01:45:46 2018|30|So how much custody does he get I can t say a dad having no custody of his kids is something I d celebrate if he isn t abusing them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 23:45:02 2018|5|Who said anything about feminism 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 23:15:40 2018|24|Do you mean curvy or fat Because people seem to use them interchangably and I have suggestions for the former but not the latter 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 22:47:08 2018|38|Where did he say that in your story You say he said after you prodded him instead of just letting the comment go I was dressed in a way females will dress if they don t want attention 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 22:38:46 2018|27|You looked different than you usually do and he made an observational comment about it If my coworker looked different than usual I d mention it too 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 22:32:36 2018|12|The gender of the person is not the weird part of this 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 22:30:33 2018|16|Why are you putting so much thought into it It just seems like an offhand comment 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 19:59:33 2018|13|I am so devastated to hear this How will I go on living 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 18:21:20 2018|18|Oh no The Men s Rights Activists won t taking me seriously Holy shit what will I do 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 18:14:18 2018|36|No they re just more concerned with shutting on women Frankly I m surprised their heads didn t explode from my original comment Upvote for criticizing women or downvote for criticizing white people What a conundrum 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 17:33:39 2018|4|Right Complacent and lazy 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 17:16:22 2018|13|Yep men do have issues Too bad MRA aren t concerned with that 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 16:38:18 2018|30|Nah between the Trump trolls MRAs and blissfully ignorant white feminists it would definitely be downvoted But I don t care I m not here to educate It s Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 16:31:15 2018|7|Observation about actual election statistics crazy racist 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 16:22:54 2018|65|No lots of people thought it would get this bad But not enough people listened When a huge chunk of the attendees at the Women s March didn t vote or voted for a third party it s impossible to say with a straight face that women didn t play a huge part in Trump being elected and it s hard to take it seriously 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 15:33:16 2018|13|When did I speak on behalf of anyone else I shared MY opinion 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 15:11:28 2018|8|Oh I m in a fine mood today 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 15:01:58 2018|25|You don t have to call her lazy You can think whatever you want about your mom and her class group But so can I 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 14:56:49 2018|39|I feel it s my job as a white women to call out the bullshit fellow white women pull Sorry your feefees are hurt because your mom thought a rapist with no political experience would be an acceptable president 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 14:45:50 2018|18|Complacency and disconnect is what got Trump elected and if the show fits your mom can wear it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 14:42:05 2018|33|I don t know why people say this like it s a good thing It just proves that the majority people don t give a shit about oppression until it directly threatens them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 14:32:00 2018|15|Too bad white women were too lazy and disconnected to be involved before Trumpwas elected
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 06:14:21 2018|4|Did you correct them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 06:02:13 2018|38|I can t think of any other product that would be stocked in two separate areas of a store Condoms are usually in the family planning area of the drug store Seems like a fine spot to me 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 02:30:48 2018|13|Don t ask questions if you don t want t hear the answers 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan 12 00:50:03 2018|14|Yes this is what I believe she is referring to thanks for the example 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 23:05:44 2018|28|I literally answered your question If they are accused and they admit they did it that is evidence that they did it It s no longer no evidence 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 22:58:36 2018|18|Yes If someone confesses to a crime I believe that they committed a crime A confession is evidence 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 22:45:02 2018|47|Yes I do think that if someone admits that they did something they re accused of doing it justifies believing that they did it How is that even a question Accuser Person did this to me Accused Yes I did do that Pretty cut and dry there 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 21:10:34 2018|5|What are dippers Like food 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 21:09:36 2018|1|Yup 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 21:08:10 2018|44|I think that is the user formally known as braided bread doxycyclist icecoldhotdog genericusername etc My advice is ignore and move on She ll get banned and end up with a new username in a few days but she s really easy to spot 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 21:02:57 2018|22|I think she is referring to people saying what Louis did wasn t as bad and shouldn t completely demolish his career 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 20:20:34 2018|145|I don t really like the continued mention on posts like this of how Terry Crews gets believed and other people don t Terry Crews has dealt with his own issues with his assault and I don t think we need to bring him in as a pissing contest or comparison At any rate I am in the middle as far as this issue goes I do absolutely believe in innocent until proven guilty but the people who are being accused are often admitting to what they have done when it gets uncovered I don t understand in that case why people continue to jump to their defense At the point where they say Yea I did this and it was a horrible thing to do I am not sure why their defenders will still bend over backwards trying to minimize things are excuse them 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 20:09:26 2018|40|The fact is though a lot of the people being accused actually admit that their accuser is telling the truth and a lot of people on Reddit still don t believe it Or they then try to defend their actions 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 18:40:09 2018|10|And also isn t legal in a lot of places 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 18:38:09 2018|74|I have to agree with the doctors here This is a mental thing People are coughing and sneezing around you and you are attributing that something you have done when it s likely they just have a cold or allergies The first guy who was likely allergic to your perfume triggered it and now you think every time someone sneezes it s because you I think you need to see a mental health professional 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 15:08:43 2018|68|First of all it will help to not shrug off and minimize the weight thing or not exercising eating right Those factors DO play a big role in conceiving especially in your 30s and you seem to be brushing off those concerns when you should be working on a healthy lifestyle plan for you both It isn t too late to fix that part Then see a doctor 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 15:00:21 2018|27|You re still taking a pill so just say you took it Or else Why don t you just ignore that it says you re extremely fertile 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 14:35:56 2018|23|OP doesn t have a boyfriend OP is a dude and this is the only way he can getvwomen to talk to him 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 04:27:57 2018|2|Me either 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 01:52:16 2018|24|Yes her name is Matilda Also Michelle Williams was on Dawson s Creek Edit this and my previous comment are hilarious things to downvote 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 01:44:59 2018|60|I think it s good to tell him Just give him the heads up and he can help with support if you need it Plus if your relationship happens to progress past being just a fling I feel like this is something that would be really difficult to disclose after the fact years from now if you are still together 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 01:42:48 2018|43|It is half his zygote in her uterus Whether he wants her to keep it really doesn t matter if she s already decided to abort it That said I do think she should tell him she is pregnant and getting an abortion 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 01:38:20 2018|8|She and Heath Ledger had a daughter together 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 00:55:56 2018|22|Wait you re lookin for a period tracker that magically knows when you are having your period without any input from you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan 11 00:44:24 2018|16|He asked for money She and other did not It reflects poorly on wahlberg if anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 22:16:55 2018|4|No it s not 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 19:43:29 2018|17|So that s you That s not we which I assume you meant to refer to women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 19:42:57 2018|182| What s ignore it mean to you I explained that in my previous post Not acknowledging the inappropriate words that the elderly person is saying Doing what you need to do and not responding to it This hasn t come up yet in this thread but is it actually confirmed that Stan Lee is mentally deteriorating Or is it just an assumption that he has dementia based on the fact he s 95 Because I can t find any reports suggesting as such The entire thread is a conversation based on the idea that he is It doesn t apply if he isn t Again like other people here you conflate saying it s not acceptable with holding people accountable Is it so hard to say that anyone being sexually harassed in their job is not acceptable I just realized You are that same person that cherry picked and couldn t accept what the norm meant You re doing the same thing for the word acceptable This isn t even worth my time any more now that I remember who you are 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 19:06:18 2018|4|It literally will OP 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 18:36:02 2018|10|I personally can t see behind my back Can you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 18:05:47 2018|8|Why can t you be upset about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 18:04:21 2018|68|These the other thing When having discussions like this it s just a well known fact that it s mostly men So constantly saying men over and over again instead of abusers definitely makes it seem like the speaker has it out for men rathe than just abusers Using the term abusers encompasses the people who are doing the terrible things and not the ones who aren t 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 17:56:40 2018|178|I didn t say to keep their mouth shut It definitely needs to be known to higher ups in the care facility so they know how to appropriately move forward Going to news outlets and bringing shame upon someone who is mentally deteriorating isn t one of the suggested ways of doing that There s not really any way to stop a person with dementia from saying bad shit It s just a thing that happens and it s sad If one can t handle hearing that sort of thing working with the elderly likely isn t the job for them as dementia is quite common The words need to be ignored The conversation if they re capable of still having one needs to be redirected If the patient is known to get physical with the care workers he should never be alone with one of them The actions are not appropriate but the person doing them no longer has the ability to understand what is or isn t okay and they cannot be held accountable for them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 16:49:55 2018|148|If you want a proper discussion about sexual abuse you need to include all people who commit it If you want to discuss just men committing it you need to specify who you re discussing In adults men commit the overwhelming majority of abuse but that is men who are abuswrs not men in general With situations with kids it s unfair to say the majority are men because you have a lot of situations of women with teen boys women who use their kids as literal sex pawns to please or stay with men women who just plain abuse their kids etc Sexual abuse is about power As grown adults men are generally stronger and have more social power so that is the way they abuse When it comes to adults and kids though adults have and abuse their power and it isn t as strictly gendered 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 16:16:32 2018|33|I mean it has t be When someone is mentally declining and unaware of what is and isn t appropriate you can t punish them for doing these things You ignore and redirect 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 06:49:41 2018|5|You could adopt a toddler
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 04:37:49 2018|7|It s whatever Do what you want 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 04:13:23 2018|16|Yea she makes it really obvious I think she has a compulsion it s really sad 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 03:34:22 2018|16|You don t hav to b friends with him Just treat him like any other customer 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 03:19:31 2018|12| We Who is we I don t text people about my period 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 01:28:50 2018|59|I just realized during the thread who that commenter is That user just constantly posts here to argue with people and then deletes her username or gets banned it varies and starts doing the same thing with a new one Don t pay her any mind Clearly a person who doesn t have much going on in her life 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 01:04:23 2018|16|So your answer is no Got it Hey how many usernames is this now 20 30 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 00:59:30 2018|33|Cool That doesn t answer my question though Can you explain to me why you feel a woman being groped on stage and handling it with tact isn t relevant to this subreddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 00:52:05 2018|42| We ask that you keep this community awesome by submitting content that is relevant to our experiences as women for women or about women Does a woman being groped on stage and handling it with tact somehow not fall within these guidelines 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 00:43:22 2018|6|Yea why wouldn t it be 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 00:17:54 2018|17|Celine Dion is a woman Her assailant is a woman This is a sub pertaining to women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan 10 00:07:55 2018|36|I wouldn t jump to that but it does seem like a group of people that don t really understand the severity of what dementia can do to a person It can really make them terrible 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  9 23:03:31 2018|43|You d be surprised Most at home care nurses aren t RNs and at any rate an RN doesn t guarantee understanding of that sort of thing People understandably tend to be very reactive with this kind of behavior before considering the possibilities 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  9 22:38:15 2018|68|You don t live in a vacuum Your roommate is at risk living in the apartment with you and there is nothing wrong with her exercising extreme caution especially when firearms are involved I get that you are feeling vulnerable about your abuse but you aren t the only person affected in this situation and she has every right to protect herself and the other people around you 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  9 22:16:45 2018|50|Me too but I think it s a little soon to put a 95 year old man on blast when acting inappropriately like this is often a sign of dementia I d wait to see if people from his younger years come out with accusations before considering him a predator 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  9 21:44:30 2018|58| When I woke up I realized that a small woman in her early 20s should not be living alone in a house Maybe you shouldn t be but that doesn t make it true for everyone I lived alone in a house from age 19 until I coupled up and I was fine Getting a dog might help 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  9 21:41:21 2018|15|Stan Lee is 95 years old They should take into account the possibility of dementia 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  9 05:32:40 2018|9|Dorothy is a total asshole and I love it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  9 05:23:58 2018|23|And Blanche gets slut shamed and there s lots of homophobic stuff But it s still a classic show and I love it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 18:09:27 2018|75|Women in Hollywood have the ability to give women opportunities and help aspiring women know they are capable So yes making a snide remark at a award show is lip service IMO Use your power and money to give more opportunities to women at a lower level and I ll take it more seriously If you re just going to talk about how things should be you re no better than someone who does nothing 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 17:54:35 2018|66|She s doing more than nothing I will give her that But I stand by what I said about it being lip service I don t find it much different than when people voted third party in the election You do that in the smallest scale and watch it grow you don t start at the top and expect that to change the bones of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 17:05:03 2018|33|It s a systematic problem in lots of places Calling it out at the highest level is like letting someone progress to stage four lung cancer instead of encouraging people to quit smoking 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 16:56:28 2018|52|I ll copy my response to the other person that said that I think that s over simplifying things It starts much earlier than that But I think it needs to be fixed much earlier than that rather than starting the criticism at such a high level That s just lip service 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 16:38:17 2018|45|I honestly am surprised if you re at all involved in the feminist movement and haven t heard the term shut up and listen before It s pretty pervasive Sit tight I ll hop on the computer and provide a few links in a bit 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 16:31:39 2018|85|You re being really rude When people are told often to shut up and listen I don t think we should be criticizing them when they do I can guarantee if a man did say anything about things while he was accepting the award he d be criticized too For women there are a lot of instances of damned if you do damned if you don t I don t think we should be doing that to men now just because we have a chance 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 16:22:22 2018|30|It s the general narrative repeated over and over in feminism circles of what men should be doing when women speak of their experiences rather than inputting their two cents 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 16:14:33 2018|21|So we are going to simultaneously tell men to shut up and listen but also criticize them for not saying anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 16:09:06 2018|2|Line breaks 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 06:14:37 2018|10|Ok the show ended like a few hours ago Chill 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 05:34:10 2018|11|Accused seems to be a weird way to put it no 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 03:50:10 2018|35|I think that s over simplifying things It starts much earlier than that But I think it needs to be fixed much earlier than that rather than starting the criticism at such a high level 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  8 03:43:03 2018|54|I m not saying there isn t a lack of female representation for directors but besides Greta Gerwig I can t think of any female director that deserved a nomination this year TBH I think we ve got to get more female directors before expecting their nominations to be equally represented at awards shows 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 18:28:38 2018|51|Oh what lovely condescension you have there I m not going to continue this conversation Which is a shame since people should be able to openly discuss this sort of thing to get better understanding But not when one person is acting morally superior to the other Have a good one 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 18:21:12 2018|181| There s a world of difference between referring to heterosexuality as the most common sexuality and referring to it as the normal sexuality No there really isn t That s what normal means Usual typical most common They re interchangeable And again by saying partner instead of boyfriend you please all of the people all of the time for zero effort So my question would be why would someone be against doing that Because it s not what pops into someone s head when they re asking the question Because most people are in heterosexual relationships and we default to that Not many people are against using the word partner so much as it s just not the first thing they think to say The respondent can say actually I m gay and then the speaker can say oh sorry girlfriend then And that s the end of it Getting angry and insulting an entire group of people because someone didn t run through all possible options in their head before asking a question is not the way to do things 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 18:08:12 2018|21|I wouldn t include you in that statement Nothing about you is beautiful but you re most likely a troll anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 18:07:13 2018|64|But it is the norm It s the usual typical state of things Saying it s not the norm isn t insulting someone and it isn t inaccurate It s a fact When a large percentage of people are one thing and a small percentage of people are another thing the larger percentage is the norm and it s natural to default to it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 18:03:54 2018|44|Yes I have been in a homosexual relationship a few times and was never fazed by assumptions I understand why someone would get annoyed after a while but I don t agree with being insulting and overly aggressive about it like OP is doing 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 17:53:27 2018|23|I d have empathy in general but you sound Ike an asshole so I don t really feel bad that you are upset 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 17:52:28 2018|5|Because most people are heterosexual 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 17:51:04 2018|4|I like male bodies 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 09:26:38 2018|33|A lot of STIs can be asymptomatic for quite a while or forever yea Most of them are not a death sentence or a one way ticket to being a social pariah though 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 08:01:47 2018|7|You re probably getting your period soon 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 07:57:45 2018|6|It sounds like a stomach bug 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 06:17:16 2018|10| Fake stats would imply that she believes they are fake 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 04:17:45 2018|17|Let him know he crossed your boundaries Stay firm and don t see him again That sucks 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 03:42:50 2018|15|If you don t know the correct stat how are you certain it was wrong 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 00:50:36 2018|63|The title says it s a myth that birth defects massively increase after 40 I shared a stat about under 40 and said it rises from there It goes from 0 5 to 1 between 35 and 40 It significantly rises after that From 40 49 it goes from 1 to 10 I guess massive is subjective but I d consider that massive 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Jan  7 00:28:41 2018|82|Birth defects rise with each year of age and they rise much faster after the age of 35 Between 35 and 40 the chance of having a baby with Down syndrome rises from 1 in 350 to 1 in 100 and just increases from there I am a person who if I have kids will not be having them until my late 30s early 40s so I don t think there s anything wrong with it but don t lie to people 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 20:51:01 2018|65|What talk are you referring to About her period Or sex There is a site called scarletteen that is really helpful IMO Also have her established with a GP or pediatrician if she isn t already A trusted medical professional is really helpful for growing adolescents Also I wish you beat the shit out of your wife in addition to that guy but I digress 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 19:34:09 2018|7|You asked for opinions That s mine 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 19:23:02 2018|42|I just don t see the point in being unrealistic about your body type If you re fat you re fat Own it But I guess that s your choice Either way a sweater would be really weird in a boudoir shoot 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 19:16:33 2018|17|If your waist is still round as indicated by having a tummy that shape is not hourglass 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 18:31:10 2018|75|It depends on what you re doing it for Is it for you or for a partner If your partner has a preference on clothes I d suggest wearing what he she likes best To be honest though a sweater for a boudoir set sounds really weird Also your description isn t an hourglass figure but based on what you ve said I don t think an open sweater would be flattering on it anyhow 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 18:09:21 2018|9|I would not really want to cuddle with either 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 12:19:20 2018|4|They should be worried 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 07:14:13 2018|21|You need a professional and you need to stay far away from this girl as you are a danger to her 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 04:55:26 2018|14|Only way to know will be a pregnancy test Good luck with whatever happens 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 04:52:40 2018|24|Definitely possible Best to have plan b at home if you re going to engage in unprotected sex Or just buy condoms use BC 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 04:22:46 2018|23|So she likes alone time Get some hobbies and then you ll have something to do when she s wanting to lay low 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 03:27:49 2018|12|Yes make a post about them Attention is definitely what they need 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 03:01:42 2018|12|You expected him to be completely monogamous with you after one date 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 01:06:44 2018|15|What kind of medical degree do you have How long have you specialized in gynecology 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jan  6 01:01:58 2018|22|I think most people understand that women have breasts and that swim suits get worn in the summer Don t overthink it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 20:25:04 2018|6| 1000 says that s a dude 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 20:09:36 2018|16|Your original comment only asked about the safety of birth control for a 13 year old 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 20:01:42 2018|25|If developing the natural way includes extremely painful period cramps and out of control acne many or most would choose to be on birth control 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 19:45:22 2018|39|Birth control is used for a variety of reasons but a 13 year old may feel embarrassed or scared to ask their parents to go on BC as they may feel it implies they are interested in having sex 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 19:43:13 2018|31|Yea I don t think any of that would literally kill me I m more than my looks which aren t even close to perfect Also almost all adolescents have BO
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 05:09:46 2018|28|Her boss literally said I don t think you can do this job properly because you re woman Does she have documentation of the offer and the retraction 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 00:44:04 2018|22|So again as I said The crux of our disagreement revolves around empathy for him I m okay being empathetic Bye now 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 00:41:41 2018|31|I ve said at least four times that the decision is hers But she isn t making the decision in a vacuum so she needs to be prepared for what happens 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 00:34:38 2018|34|So the crux of our disagreement is that I think the guy deserves some empathy in this situation and you think he doesn t deserve any empathy I m okay being empathetic Take care 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 00:21:51 2018|11| I never once implied that he kind of has it coming
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 00:19:08 2018|128|You sound like a terribly spiteful person if this is what you honestly think Oh he broke up with her so she s going to abort his baby Serves him right seriously wtf is that Their romantic relationship and their parenting relationship need to be looked at as two separate things It s not a tit for tat thing Obviously the decision is hers and she needs to make what she feels is the best decision But regardless of that fact anyone with any shred of human decency would be at least a little concerned or empathetic to the fact that he was preparing to be a father and now will not be one Two separate people can raise a great kid regardless of their own personal relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 00:08:13 2018|43|I assume that response is in reference to my first paragraph As I said it s your choice and if you think that this will be the best one in the long run definitely go with what you feel is the best decision 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jan  5 00:06:42 2018|178| Sorry but who cares if it s traumatizing for him Probably anyone with a shred of empathy for a person who is looking forward to being a father It s her life that is going to get completely turned upside down if she has this kid I reckon both their lives will be affected by having a kid if he s set on being a father to it Her body her choice Absolutely They will both be sad but that s too damn bad Yes certainly too bad I m not sure that being cold and callous about either of their feelings is the way to go though Just because he wants to have his cake and eat it too doesn t mean she s the bad guy if she decides to abort I didn t say she s the bad guy if she wants to abort but considering they came to the decision to keep the pregnancy together she needs to be prepared for him to feel extremely upset at her decision to go back on that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan  4 23:24:08 2018|84|It s of course your choice in the end but make sure you aren t just contemplating abortion as a way to punish him for ending your relationship I m not saying you are outrightly vindictive in that way but the subconscious on top of pregnancy hormones can convince us of a lot things It sounds like you both agreed that keeping the child was a good idea in the first place Changing your mind about it is going to be traumatizing for him 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan  4 23:14:21 2018|43|Did he tell you he wasn t interested in being a father when he broke up with you It sounds from what you ve said that he just doesn t want to be with you not that he doesn t want the kid 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan  4 18:59:40 2018|38|I like having dresses with pockets when they are flared at the waist but I understand why fitted skinny jeans or fitted dresses general don t have pockets Putting stuff in those pockets makes the clothing fit weird 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan  4 04:10:14 2018|90| You don t find it has value in causing the population to pay attention to foreign policy and what wars we get ourselves into No If it did our population wouldn t have elected a person that is trying his damnedest to start WWIII Also the world didn t magically become safer just because nuclear weapons have kept us from having major wars for the last 70 years I don t think it did Nor did I say that No one should be forced to serve Period End of story 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan  4 00:24:56 2018|31|Just get it anyway It won t be as effective because you ve probably been exposed to some of the strains it covers but it isn t going to hurt you 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jan  4 00:09:00 2018|9|No I think the selective service should be eliminated 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan  3 22:58:32 2018|14|Or more often they are just in a monogamous relationship where no one cheats 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan  3 22:48:34 2018|11|No I haven t noticed that because it isn t true 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan  3 17:47:45 2018|2| r gatekeeping
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan  3 17:47:06 2018|45|Socially awkward people often have a way of making those around them uncomfortable due to second hand embarrassment I ve been on both sides of this To say that being socially awkward only affects the person who is awkward is not accurate outside a vacuum 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan  3 17:37:00 2018|14| socially awkward That s the issue People likely don t feel comfortable around her 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan  3 17:27:44 2018|25|Nothing wrong with being nerdy or liking the things you do but why wouldn t you want to change your inability to comfortably function socially 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan  3 02:38:27 2018|63|I don t think you re using the word hypocritical correctly At any rate the sub FAQ clearly states that anyone is welcome to post here which means it s not being exclusive If you have an issue with the name you can choose not to do so but don t blame it on the sub being unwelcoming That s your own choice 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Jan  3 02:30:37 2018|15|It s covered in the FAQ so I reckon that s why it got deleted 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  2 21:16:33 2018|15|OK good at least they did that Unfortunately nothing is 100 effective Sorry this happened 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  2 21:10:12 2018|13|Out of curiosity they had you take a pregnancy test before insertion right 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  2 05:38:50 2018|85|What do you consider a decent point You seem to have posted here to ask whether you acted appropriately in a situation since you have been a shitty person in the past and have no moral compass My opinion is that you didn t act appropriately Take it or leave it I don t care You re the one that loses out in the end when you keep having failed and dysfunctional relationships because you aren t capable of acting like a normal person Toodles 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  2 05:34:59 2018|14|So you only posted here to hear from people who think you acted appropriately 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  2 05:32:16 2018|24|Being embarrassed isn t childish but the rest of your conduct in response to embarrassment certainly was As well as your response Good going 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jan  2 05:17:22 2018|30|I m inclined to side wi him on this one You acted like a complete child However your relationship sounds toxic miso it s probably best to end it anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 22:34:56 2018|16|She says she has HPV not HSV Her title says he thinks she gave him HSV 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 19:43:38 2018|33|Giving birth to one s own child is a life changing experience for a lot of women And that requires being pregnant A lot of women truly embrace pregnancy gross stuff and all 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 19:05:50 2018|14|OP s phrasing is the problem not the lack of desire to be pregnant 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 17:23:49 2018|15|I did read the details What happens when you dust the rest of the house 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 16:34:34 2018|31|Why d you delete your post OP And who cares what he s doing right now He works all week He has earned his time to play on his cell phone 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 16:28:39 2018|58|I m guessing it s problem the principle of it rather than the time it takes He works all week to support the family so he probably feels like housework should be your task I m inclined to agree Ask him if the housekeeper can come more than once a month if you really can t do this 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 04:51:42 2018|10|Wearing thin clothes in the cold doesn t cause illness 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 04:32:17 2018|16|You are the salty virgin who thinks a woman s clothing can harm her health yea 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 04:27:34 2018|4|Uhm laugh at you 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 04:20:40 2018|2|hahaha wow 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 04:17:27 2018|10|If that isn t the pot calling the kettle black 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 04:10:15 2018|17|Guess they need to be more marketable than oh I can play video games look at me 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 04:09:37 2018|16|Hey if they re not able to pull the crowds that s their problem not hers 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 04:06:39 2018|17|So they were jealous of her success and slut shamed her I revert to my original point 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 03:22:38 2018|14|Sounds like they were being assholes so she picked the easiest lowest hanging fruit 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 02:54:50 2018|8|You need therapy Reddit can not fix you 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jan  1 02:44:55 2018|27|You should clarify though that this article isn t encouraging women to do that It s using that as one example of how ridiculous things are getting 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:34:32 2017|21|I m literally using the exact language she used in her title just repeating it with my opinion instead of hers 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:28:15 2017|14|Putting her friend on blast isn t the way to be genuine or heartfelt 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:27:46 2017|23|Looks like we disagree I don t feel like repeating myself again so you can just read my last comment Happy New Year 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:21:54 2017|49|Because the main reason people are doing what her friend is doing is because of what the shitty rich people have done I m not going to berate people who are victims of society They are a symptom I m going to go after the cause of the problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:19:07 2017|18|So why is she allowed to share her opinion but I can t share my response to it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:15:04 2017|12|I edited it immediately after sending it I pressed send too quickly 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:10:29 2017|24|I think universal healthcare should be a thing so I don t have an issue with contributing to the payment of others hospital bills 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:08:07 2017|31|I did read it I just don t see why she thinks she would be automatically offered a job at a lower level especially if she didn t apply for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:50:08 2017|13|No I m just someone who doesn t meddle in others life affairs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:49:36 2017|16|I don t but I don t care how other people choose to live their lives 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:36:04 2017|16|Stop telling other people how to live their lives in 2018 Mind your own damn business 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:33:43 2017|9|How is it logical to give someone a demotion 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:18:19 2017|12|Well why would she get a job she didn t apply for 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 19:48:22 2017|7|Did you apply for your old position 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 06:52:44 2017|11|The right to live their lives without those kinds of inconveniences 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 06:38:44 2017|23|We could have female legislators continually try to pass laws that make it difficult for men to obtain condoms and maintain bodily autonomy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 06:12:28 2017|21|Because women still need to be brought to a level playing field with men before we concentrate on keeping everything equal 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 05:32:38 2017|6|This sounds pretty normal to me 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 30 10:17:02 2017|8|Then why did you set up a date 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 30 10:09:59 2017|16|And you met him while he was working and spoke to him while he was working 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 30 10:06:23 2017|44|How on earth can you know that from texting He probably just doesn t like sitting around texting That is boring Though I suppose in that case you should cancel the date because he might not be interested in constantly texting and you are 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 30 09:36:18 2017|25|Uh so wait why are you cancelling the date Because he had a long day and didn t want to text you through the night 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 19:09:48 2017|4|Again you re welcome 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 19:06:05 2017|1|Right 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:59:42 2017|14|I m not bothered I just don t think childish behavior should be applauded 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:58:06 2017|10|Just replace the cookies and tell her you ate them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:51:14 2017|29|There are more positive ways to lighten the weight of it all than doing this Go on a nice walk Find a new hobby Volunteer at an animal shelter 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:41:15 2017|40|I don t think acting like a child is something to brag about If you re going to act like that then that s your choice But why post on here like it s something you re proud of doing 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:31:10 2017|10|Ignoring him is probably more effective than giving him attention 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 17:31:14 2017|117|Honestly if you feel having an abortion will harm your mental health more than being pregnant you can follow through with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption It s not ideal but at least the baby will have a stabile environment once it s out of the womb My personal opinion is that due to your addiction and a non supportive partner it might be best to get an abortion but no one should be making that decision for you Don t let people tell you that you re a bad person or that you are wrong for choosing to abort and don t let them do that if you choose not to abort 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 03:07:44 2017|24|That s a pretty normal goodbye gesture much like a handshake IMO unless you re describing something completely different than what I m imagining 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 02:06:41 2017|32|If you re wife is the one who doesn t like guns and she said not to make it a thing I don t know why you aren t listening to her 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 00:22:38 2017|7|He asked her and she said yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 21:46:22 2017|6|Ain t nothing wrong with sarcasm 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 17:47:36 2017|29|pile of garbage unfortunately used as fuel by MRAs and the like to find weak spots and hypocrisy in feminism since as if she s the spokesperson for women 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 12:07:31 2017|44|I don t care If a 30 year old is capable of being around a typical 18 year old for an extended amount of time without going completely insane he is likely extremely immature for his age and should probably be dating younger anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 12:05:36 2017|46|Wow This is next level what about is They can write an article discussing why this girl is incredible without saying Malala gets all the attention It s always Malala Malala Malala Leave her out of it She deserves the attention and praise she has gotten 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 11:58:17 2017|18|Wouldn t a positive experience be I did not get pregnant and have to go get an abortion 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 01:06:32 2017|27|If he was the one then you wouldn t have cheated on him for five months with his best friend Learn from your mistakes and move on 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 00:01:51 2017|5|Paradigms don t shift overnight 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 20:27:04 2017|4|What did they do 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 16:42:14 2017|58|I d never expect my partner to stay home with me when I m sick unless I was truly incapacitated and unable to to move or function without assistance You re on Reddit which means that isn t the case I think the care package was very nice of him and he isn t being inconsiderate by going 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 05:01:56 2017|34|As I said there are a lot of options between the two and you re going to have a hard time finding a doctor who will jump to that extreme procedure before trying them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 04:56:11 2017|1|125 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 04:51:54 2017|44|There are a lot of steps between replace my IUD and remove my uterus Regardless of your age be taking that into account ESPECIALLY because of your age there are very few doctors that would jump to something so severe and with good reason 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 26 23:22:51 2017|28|Gamer dudes whine and complain about women not wanting to date them that seems to be enough proof that there are people who don t find gaming attractive 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 26 01:22:01 2017|39|It s not an attractive hobby to a lot of people Nothing wrong wi that Edit uh oh someone s feelings are hurt Sorry not gaming isn t a hobby that is attractive to some people Get over it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 23:57:53 2017|8|It s just an addiction like anything else 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 20:03:22 2017|64|If you re too sick to leave the house you re too sick to leave the house If there are conditions which you would leave the house then you aren t too sick to leave the house You aren t going because you don t want to go It s fine to not want to go but claiming you are too sick is inconsistent 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 19:53:44 2017|75|Sounds like typical family drama and your mom sounds kinda jerky but if I hadn t and I was sick I would ve definitely went today regardless of how I feltIf you re so sick you can t possibly go today why would you magically not be too sick to go in this other scenario It s inconsistent and makes it seem like you aren t going just because you don t feel like it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 07:49:56 2017|31|No one is obligated to do anything they don t want to do regardless of their past If you aren t able to process that and accept it date a virgin 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 05:24:35 2017|32|Do you get all holidays off work Even Halloween and stuff like that You re really lucky Anyhow just move the day and celebrate it in a day you re both off 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 05:21:57 2017|21|It s not reality though Fathers are responsible for child support and it s your opinion that they shouldn t be 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 02:26:42 2017|8|You re 35 not 75 Get a grip 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 02:11:18 2017|7|I don t care about your opinion 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 02:10:35 2017|22|Once it s not an issue of autonomy he can have equal say Not til then though Sorry can t change biology 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 01:20:50 2017|61|I m not evading it I don t address and argue about unrealistic what ifs for real life situations He s not arguing any point because false premises are not points If there isn t a child there isn t a child to get custody of But we could keep repeating ourselves over and over if you want That seems productive 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 01:05:11 2017|55|He asked about if the guy wants the child A child has to first exist for him to be able to say he wants it If she has an abortion there is no child and there never was I don t make the rules of biology and I don t argue hypotheticals That is unreasonable 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 23:48:23 2017|9|If she had an abortion there is no child 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 23:21:33 2017|18|If he wants the child he can go to court and get partial or full custody of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 22:42:01 2017|51|Disagree After the child is born it deserves to have support It s no longer simply a medical decision for one person If the mother can financially support it in her own then that s fine But if it needs supplemental support the father is one that needs to provide it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 22:38:24 2017|7|Depends on the situation but usually yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 22:22:05 2017|11|No one deserves any power over anyone else s medical decisions 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 22:14:06 2017|26|He should have zero control over whether or not she has an abortion What happens afterwards should be dealt with on a case by case basis 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 18:15:26 2017|23|Is it a huge secret if he knew about it Are you on a public dating site Then it isn t private business 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 18:06:34 2017|16|Probably stop holding this against your brother when your sister is the one being an asshole 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 16:04:12 2017|14|Be competent and most people will treat you as competent Not all but most

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 22:58:18 2017|6|How far along would you be 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 20:27:04 2017|30|Absolutely not Unless she wants to reveal what a petty manipulative score keeper she is Though my guess is if they ve been together six years he already knows it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 19:56:10 2017|58|I think it s good that he recognizes its origins and there s nothing wrong with him telling you his opinion Obviously it s your prerogative as to whether you will shave or not but he sounds like a pretty good dude and if I were in your position I personally would probably give this one to him 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 17:19:42 2017|6|Utis aren t in the vagina 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 16:52:46 2017|20|Is English your second language or I could try explaining it in other terms since this seems confusing for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 16:44:33 2017|6|What part of this lacks that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 13:43:14 2017|47|None of those situations you mentioned grinning and bearing it involve you having to deal with people insulting and abusing you for his sake do they You literally say in the description that you didn t mind doing them Well he minds doing this so respect that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 13:29:17 2017|104|If you feel okay going that s your business but expecting him to go after your family was rude to him is out of line and unsupportive Did they apologize to him and to you for the comments It is completely within reason that he avoids them and for you to accuse him of not supporting you because he won t stand for abuse from your family doesn t shine a very nice light on you as a partner Also your theatrics just sound manipulative If this is causing such and over the top response I think you need to find a good therapist 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 13:05:13 2017|23|I don t either but you keep acting like having the desire to do so is repulsive and disgusting so here we are 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 12:56:04 2017|24|Pretty sure not kissing a baby despite wanting to kiss a baby is having functional boundaries but thanks for the low key condescension anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 12:54:26 2017|6|Are you the thought police now 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 05:11:00 2017|14|It s not unheard of but in this instance she is being super dramatic 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 04:32:18 2017|12|You can unmatch and block them Staying matched with someone implies interest 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 04:03:02 2017|37|So you were talking to a guy then didn t talk to him for a while but stayed matched wi him and it is terrifying that he asked what was up and whether you were still interested 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 03:30:35 2017|17|Thinking is fine Doing is the problem Those little guys are just so cute and kissable looking 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 02:35:40 2017|29|I m not saying they should do it but to act like it is a disgusting to even think of kissing a baby is a bit over the top 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 01:57:26 2017|27|I dunno how many babies you ve held but sometimes it takes a lot of restraint to not give a baby a smooch They re so cute 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 01:41:24 2017|47|I d just have a no adults kissing the baby rule period Considering how prolific herpes is not to mention other illnesses that s just the safest route and it doesn t single out one friend I have serious doubts she s your only friend with herpes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 01:13:00 2017|109|It sounds like he just doesn t like his job and feels it was a lot of time and money put into something with little reward Honestly from my experience being a nurse gives you more patient time which is a good and bad and is a really good job for someone with good social skills Because it s very focused around patient interaction A lot of doctors lack that because they ve focused so hard on their trade So they can do the specific thing they went to school for very well but have trouble in other areas of their lives Nurses tend to be more well rounded 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 01:09:00 2017|24|That s what dating is for You get to know someone to see if you re compatible If you aren t you stop dating 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 19:29:25 2017|8|It s like the Iranian version of Footloose 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 16:12:39 2017|13|If 115lbs was a healthy weight for her she is likely pretty short 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 16:08:55 2017|27|I don t think it s a bad idea but I definitely understand how it could be a problem for people who can t afford that upfront 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:55:23 2017|20|That s interesting I ve never heard of it but I ve only worked in three clinics in my career 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:54:27 2017|24|Yea I don t think shaming is the right word here though I don t think it was appropriate for her to say anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:53:35 2017|22|It s actually retail 101 to not comment on customer s purchases when working in a place such as a drug store 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:51:36 2017|6|You can sit down to pee 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:01:30 2017|70|I feel like being aggressive toward a partner when they ask a question you don t like isn t the way to keep a happy relationship Explaining why you don t think the question is appropriate and hopefully coming to an understanding is probably a better route I d hate to be with a person that gives such a terse and dickish answer when I try to ask them something 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 05:31:07 2017|23|I never kept count and I don t discuss something like that with my partner so I have never lied about it before 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 04:20:32 2017|1|what 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 20 01:22:04 2017|24|Are you implying that men dying alone in their houses after falling is a big problem but that it doesn t happen to women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 20 00:52:33 2017|60|No you just say in the post that she doesn t lock her phone That doesn t give anyone including you a right to look at her texts without her permission If you don t think it s a big deal why don t you tell her Sounds like you know she ll be mad that you invaded her privacy 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 20 00:47:23 2017|19|I think it s important that she knows you think it s okay to invade her privacy like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 20 00:34:41 2017|17|Why don t you tell your girlfriend you snooped through her phone and take it from there 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 23:27:28 2017|7|Why can t you leave your house 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 23:17:35 2017|22|You should probably just mind your business and get over it considering you haven t even worked there for over a year 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 23:14:03 2017|17|Maybe get a life alert thing That way you will be able to get help if needed 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 21:25:04 2017|8|I have never been choked by TJ Miller 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 18:43:32 2017|19|It sounds like he was passing down advice from what he learned when he was new to the job 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 22:13:53 2017|15|So then wouldn t that be equally unfair to the men in the company too 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 18:40:30 2017|58|I m talking about the woman you re agreeing with At any rate yea when you have general info the best to give is general advice which is it is completely circumstantial and there is not one right way to choose not being a stay at home parent is a stupid choice and you ll end up poor 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 18:15:48 2017|22|You and your buddy keep making these sweeping generalizations about things when you have no idea about each person s individual situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 17:32:50 2017|29|No I m pretty sure the idea that having children isn t a one size fits all thing is a good argument regardless of the age of the children 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:47:50 2017|32|I mean if you re comfortable being an asshole who doesn t take sexual harassment seriously there s no magic words that will change that So I guess just keep sucking Peace 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:38:01 2017|71|There isn t anyone who is going to suddenly stop believing victims because they disagree with what one celebrity says If one person s opinion on harassment is enough to make you dubious of anyone that comes forward with allegations you were already on the wrong side of the debate to begin with you were just looking for an easy scapegoat in order to begin your overt defense of shitty behavior 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:30:41 2017|126| When she attacked Matt Damon for saying we should look at these cases on the contents of the actions and not judge all of them the same she is shattering any reasonable definition of what is what Wow Rose McGowan sure has a lot of power over you if you think she can change the definition of words Did she change her last name to McGowan from Merriam Webster when she got famous or something That means that when you say harassment now people will think of things that most don t see as harassment and nobody will care Wait What You mean to tell me people will doubt when a victim speaks out about sexual assault or harassment No way Real change of pace there 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:24:07 2017|11|What does she have to do with me not condoning harassment 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:18:29 2017|7|Who is she making a fool of 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 05:28:05 2017|28|In a lot of areas it s a more financially sound choice to have a stay at home parent and paying for childcare is the bigger financial sacrifice 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 04:24:03 2017|73|The fact that you had to give up your friends for him should have been your first red flag It s time to stop making excuses on why you can t leave him This isn t the first time you ve made a post bitching about him You delete them and then a few days later make another one You re responsible for making your life better Complaining does nothing Make it better 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 03:33:04 2017|18|So then break up with him You don t even like him so why are you with him 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 03:08:12 2017|63|I kind of think it depends on what the present was Like if they got you a Bookshelf and he was putting it together for you that s kind of sweet If it was a puzzle that s kind of shitty Either way it s just something to talk about Dwelling on it and making it a big deal doesn t help anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 16 18:20:37 2017|34|Some of these things listed in the article are legit struggles but some of them are eye rollingly incelly and entitled All in all the article breaks even and doesn t really accomplish anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 16 03:51:01 2017|23|No it isn t Some people don t feel the need to document everything with pictures Some people prefer to just experience it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 14 18:26:59 2017|23|Many of these movies are just terrible chick flick or not Breakfast at Tiffany s is epically racist I ll give them that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 14 06:20:27 2017|23|You have his name and social media account You don t need to stalk him or your sister Let her live her life 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 14 06:01:59 2017|38|Is your sister and adult without any mental delays Then let her make her own decisions and stop meddling Ask her to give you the address where she will be staying and beyond that mind your own business 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 13 22:56:25 2017|13|Why are you telling her what her boundaries should be in her relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 13 04:21:42 2017|20|Alabaman white people are apparently if they thought a child molester was a good choice of Senate which they did 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 13 00:24:02 2017|26|Yes I think we ve established that some people disagree with me Everyone s entitled to their opinion I don t think it s relevant here 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 13 00:14:46 2017|31|I have no issues with men I just don t think any article about men belongs on a woman s subreddit just because there is a blurb about women in it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 12 23:38:18 2017|26|I think an article specifically about that rather than an article based around men and the problems men face would be more relevant for this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 12 23:20:45 2017|20|Yes I did read the article which is why I said it seems more suitable for a men s subreddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 12 22:40:51 2017|11|more suitable for a man s subreddit don t you think 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 11 05:15:09 2017|31|It s likely that her constant visits seem to them as drug seeking behavior Is she seeing an orthopedist or is she going to the ER every time she gets hurt 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 11 00:21:54 2017|46|I mean they share a wall I would be surprised if she didn t hear less than yelling sometimes That doesn t make it abuse I can hear when my neighbor yells to his wife in the other room It depends on what is being said 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 10 16:25:26 2017|72|I actually also have celiac and have a gf baking business on the side But what you are sourcing says that GF replacement products are bad for you which is absolutely true but no one needs to be eating those products though it s nice that they do since it makes me money Eating a nutrient rich diet of plenty fruits veggies meats nuts etc is a totally fine way to live 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 10 16:08:46 2017|45|What It isn t unhealthy to eat gluten free without an intolerance It just isn t necessary No one needs to eat gluten and no one is going to suffer any vitamin deficiencies from not eating it There s just no reason to completely abstain 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 10 04:36:52 2017|7|I think this belongs in r thinlydisguisedrants
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 19:24:16 2017|38|Your post was shitty to begin with And no there s a reason things require an exam before diagnosis But I guess keep pretending to be a doctor on Reddit if that s what you like to do 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 19:06:33 2017|23|Yea no Someone who is medically trained knows better than to make a presumptuous conclusion about a person they see on the street 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 18:08:20 2017|11|How do you know she s not just a thin person 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 04:48:17 2017|8|Maybe you should have worn a condom then 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 04:47:07 2017|15|Glad you re okay but what does this have to do with being a woman 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:36:22 2017|6|Better start saving up short stuff 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:36:07 2017|15|Because you re incredibly immature and if you are an adult that s a problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:23:34 2017|4|Yea you do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:20:40 2017|32|Saying someone is too short for his tastes is about the most benign and least insulting critique I ve heard I hope you are a teenager because if not this is absurd 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:18:16 2017|18|Okay fine whatever You re too short Yup End of the world What are you going to do 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:57:30 2017|27|He said you were short for his tastes Grow up and get over it You re making this into a thing when it really doesn t matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:49:48 2017|17|Because you re implying that only super tall men can like taller women Everyone can have preferences 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:46:17 2017|3|Why are yu
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:27:15 2017|43|The world average takes into account Asian countries where the height is a lot shorter than most other areas I assumed you were in the US My mistake But either way dude doesn t want to date you so it s pretty irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:11:30 2017|27|Disliking and avoiding over half the population based on preconceived notions is the sign of a person who doesn t reflect on their own flaws very well 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:08:03 2017|9|It s average He probably just prefers tall women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 19:41:15 2017|5|Odd how your tone changed 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 19:04:33 2017|25|I didn t say anything about this post cupcake Dude made a generalization about the women on this sub so I did it right back 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 16:14:51 2017|22| and more than half the men are MRA shit bags who try to undermine anything women say so what s your point 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 05:54:21 2017|36|Yea I totally believe you At any rate patients don t appreciate ambiguous answers They aren t satisfied with vague cop outs So they re going to be pissed either way Might as well be honest 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 05:44:48 2017|13|You work in the medical field but ask medical questions on Reddit K 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 05:36:52 2017|7|Do you work in the medical field 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 03:55:53 2017|79|As far as your idea that he s gotten so much backing you ve got confirmation bias He has received a lot of criticism too And no there s no way that you can say any of this without sounding shitty You re doing whataboutism while complaining about whataboutism You re upset that a guy who got sexually assault is getting support This isn t a pissing contest Anyone receiving support after a sexual assault is a good thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 03:44:17 2017|57|No I m not uncomfortable with people being supportive of Terry Crews He deserves all the support he is getting Just because other people also deserve support and belief doesn t make his any less important And the poor guy has been getting a lot of hate and discrimination too Because he is a big black man 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 03:26:35 2017|65| I don t know manNot a man I think the potential for negative public backlash is WAY higher with this than just generally being unavailable It s about equal either way but at least he s being honest Most people want to know why their doctor decided to pawn them off on another person and giving an ambiguous reason will just piss them off more 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec  5 23:17:05 2017|78| It seems unprofessional because it s giving out his personal information possibly without his consent Why do you think it is without his consent I think just saying he s unavailable or dealing with another patient neither of which is exactly a lie would be more appropriate Which could also cause a negative Yelp review People will find any reason to complain about a doctor Better to be transparent about the reason than to give something so ambiguous 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec  5 19:24:18 2017|50|I wouldn t equate that with a company donating specifically to him It s like if someone sells guns to a person who then commits a mass shooting Should they take some responsibility for selling those guns Of course Would I say that literally murdered those people Not so sure 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec  5 18:43:23 2017|15|It looks like they donated to the RNC not to Roy Moore s campaign specifically

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:38:49 2017|16|He pushed her to get her away from the door when she was trying to leave 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:34:23 2017|36|He literally physically abused her Even if you for some stupid reason don t think his other behavior was abusive I m not sure how physical abuse doesn t go under the abuse column for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:22:21 2017|46|No most guys don t do that Don t try to legitimize your abusive behavior just because you were able to manipulate your partner into thinking it s normal My condolences to your wife and the children you are raising I hope they somehow learn better 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:18:13 2017|15|You need to talk to your parents and have them find you a good therapist 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 20:59:07 2017|50|No there is never a need for aggression regardless of gender Teaching little girls that being an asshole is okay as long as you get your way is not progressive Making boundaries and keeping them is absolutely fine Maxine Waters is a great example of this Never aggressive Always assertive 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 20:32:40 2017|8|No Be assertive Aggression is never the answer 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 15:24:39 2017|20|Broken clock is right twice a day I m not going to piss and moan about it when it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 15:04:06 2017|44|No Lena Dunham is cancer Women need to stop defending her just because she s a woman I am a woman and I love and appreciate women but she doesn t deserve any respect regardless of how you want to rationalize her shitty behavior 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 14:59:21 2017|20|Defending rapists and diddling your kid sister is probably advancing society a lot less than calling someone out for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 00:07:11 2017|22|You know what forget it Yes You will be like this for your entire life because you are too stubborn to listen 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:54:08 2017|43|You re making the conscious choice to do that You know you re doing wrong and you won t do anything to make it right That s your choice You are choosing to live the rest of your life as a shit bag 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:52:51 2017|20|Then keep having a horrible life where you constantly feel like shit I guess Best of luck with all that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:49:21 2017|8|There you go with your manipulative language again 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:47:59 2017|18|So you re just milking their time rather than both their time and money Very magnanimous of you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:36:03 2017|33|I read the comments before you posted it though there were few and all of them had advice It s still advice even when you don t like it and hurts your feelings 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:29:22 2017|52|Don t do shitty stuff and people won t put you down for doing shitty stuff People gave you advice You claimed you can t do it and then shifted straight to guess I ll kill myself mode Go get therapy You ll learn exactly how manipulative your words and actions are 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:13:38 2017|68|People at criticizing you and instead of reflecting on what they re saying you are playing the victim card with your Guess I ll just kill myself stuff Don t ask for advice if you re just going to whine about it You put yourself in the situation and you can get out of it You just don t want to put in the effort to do it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:10:00 2017|15|So on top of all you listed in the post you re also manipulative Cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 02:17:14 2017|14|But what does that have to do with her changing last name or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 01:11:55 2017|23|I don t understand why him being an only child is relevant in this Are you wanting him to change his last name 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 01:07:07 2017|72|It s your choice where you threshold is for political differences No one else can decide that for you What worries me the most about this is what happens if an accidental pregnancy were to occur Would he support me He d support you in keeping it it seems like Although it wouldn t be all that unusual for someone to manipulate a person into keeping a kid and then leaving them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 00:12:19 2017|26|It s actually a good core strengthening move I think the anxiety and illness are more closely associated with your issue than holding in your stomach 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 21:06:52 2017|27|Ehhhhhh I dunno about that I wouldn t consider the guy who voiced Aladdin automatically relevant in modern day just because he played a character I liked 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 20:49:01 2017|9|Beauty and the Beast was made in 94 though 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 19:58:42 2017|33|I m dismissing her viewpoint because it s stupid and outdated baselessOh is she somehow relevant What has she done recently that makes her a voice of importance in this day and age 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 19:43:30 2017|53| Legally HIPPA I am surprised about how many people on Reddit are such experts on HIPAA yet don t the proper acronym I would not worry about it It is not illegal to do what you did It is not a crimeYes it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle under the influence 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 17:26:40 2017|75|Sometimes And sometimes not But it s odd that some people here are the thought police It sounds like these people were having a drunken candid conversation If they re calling her up and telling her they re fantasizing about her or bring it up every time they see her I can understand the aversion But this strikes me as a drunken conversation that traveled to that neck of the woods not a regular occurrence 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 15:45:05 2017|18|A story about them would probably be more useful than giving a voice to someone irrelevant and powerless 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 15:05:32 2017|8|Old person has outdated views Story at 11 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 10:19:43 2017|6|Confessing dumb stuff during drunken banter 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 04:47:25 2017|22|Then I reckon you should change the wording of the body of your text And then also get the fuck over it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 04:44:50 2017|19|Then don t visit all You said your front page If you unsubscribe it will not show up there 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 04:41:42 2017|4|You can just unsubscribe 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 02:31:32 2017|20|You seem to be underweight and malnourished Eating a balanced diet is a good start to getting back on track 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 02:29:48 2017|52|They view attractive women sexually If they re not doing or saying anything to you that is inappropriate best to just forget it But it s it really a gender divide as far as this goes Many women fantasize about attractive men too Being in a relationship doesn t make us blind 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 06:16:36 2017|2|That good 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 05:00:37 2017|35| November 26 2017 The day we beat sexism by convincing op to call her bank Remember the date November 26 2017 The day we beat sexism by griping about it on reddit Remember the date 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 04:50:27 2017|164| Opposed to what ignoring it Do you think they need reddit s expert advice on how to contact their bank and ask them to address mail to the mortgage holder Apparently so considering they haven t done it yet and this isn t the first time it has happened according to OP I know I d be livid And if you read the rest of the comments some people answered her question As did I I m a woman who owns a home and have not had this happen to me despite having an obviously female name Getting the name changed should be easy And yet they haven t done it Addressing the root problem seems to be the point of the thread Yes and We are in the future now It has already happened They can t go back in time and ensure that they know Leigh is a man or change the history of sexism They can only act from the present 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 04:45:03 2017|6|That s what it sounds like 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 04:27:08 2017|42| The letter should be address to him and him only Even if they think he is a woman but it isn t So he needs to contact them and them know they shouldn t be sending mail addressed to anyone but him 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 03:41:32 2017|149| She made a conscious effort not to include me in one of the most important life events a woman can have You think she was sitting there planning the baby coming along and was like I m going to invite everyone but u scarletdragonflyfl because fuck her It s a super self involved mindset to think she made the conscious decision to leave you out It s likely she didn t even think of you to begin with She was probably just considering people who lived closer to her and were still in her life rather than everyone from her past You guys grew apart you probably weren t on the top of her list to include in things I understand that it hurt your feelings but you re acting like she did it with malicious intent She had a baby It s got nothing to do with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 21:12:48 2017|71|The person handling customer service likely has nothing to do with the error so laying into them just makes their day worse for something they have no control over It s hard working in customer service They re the punching bags for literally everything it s good to have some compassion Calling and making the error known of course Calling and laying into the person who is tying to help rude 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 19:19:37 2017|53|I just thought of this if the mortgage company knows the mortgage holder is a male I assume they have that somewhere maybe they use that terminology because of the female name Like they see the mortgage holder is a guy so they assume that guy is not Leigh but Leigh s husband 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 18:46:52 2017|76|I have not had this issue and I have a very obviously female name Sounds like some kind of internal error If your husband bought it when single and didn t add anyone to the deed he should contact them and let them know that they shouldn t be sending mail addressed to anyone but him I m surprised that you haven t had him do that yet considering how much it seems to bother you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 16:16:31 2017|112|So I guess my prerogative is that you don t really know him well enough to know if this is normal behavior for him that has nothing to do with you Full disclosure I m a person that falls asleep really easily and stays asleep through things like texts and phone calls though I might answer them I m not actually awake when I do If someone doesn t jostle me awake I ll sleep for hours I m not saying you have to date him but I am saying it might just be who he is and he isn t doing it consciously or subconsciously to show his lack of caring 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 16:08:47 2017|8|So you have been together for a month 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 16:01:27 2017|19|You didn t listen to the advice given in the original post so why are you asking for more 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 15:59:24 2017|14|Does he have a busy life What s the time period between these events 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 22:44:21 2017|7|So then just ignore and move on 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 22:42:48 2017|66|I don t think it necessary to support someone based on their gender Not into cat fights backstabbing pettiness and such but I m not going to automatically support everything a person does because she s a woman Sorry whatever happened to you but your rant does seem a bit targeted toward a specific person so it s probably better to take it up with them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 22:32:09 2017|14|Why don t you just PM them or reply to their comment or something 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 21:08:30 2017|30|Sweet Jesus don t do that Your body is confused as hell right now so you re not going to get your period Hopefully you didn t cause any damage 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 16:24:45 2017|10|Yea you just need to be chivalrous regardless of gender 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 05:31:01 2017|35|I responded directly to everything you said If you have no valid response it s fine to be done with me but don t turn it around on me like I m the problem here 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 05:23:28 2017|74|No one here is offended by the word vagina The majority of commenters like me don t see why you re so stuck on her saying it Kids have different comfort levels Challenging her comfort level to the point of tears over something as arbitrary as what she calls a vagina is really sad She can say it when she feels okay saying it Until then let her say whatever she feels comfortable saying 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 05:07:18 2017|63|It doesn t make sense not to force your daughter to say something she doesn t want to say This is a surefire way of traumatizing her into never being comfortable saying it She s 8 years old Chill out Plus if you re into splitting hairs and using proper terms always which clearly you are it s a vulva not a vagina 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 04:56:40 2017|24|If it upsets her that much stop saying it She doesn t need to say the word vagina if it makes her so uncomfortable 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 03:08:24 2017|10|Hair grows a half an inch per month on average 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 02:10:38 2017|4|Eight months on average 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 01:21:07 2017|22|Those last two situations don t really seem like they were hitting on you The first one definitely wasn t cool though 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 01:02:59 2017|7|You were the one who asked Cupcake 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 00:43:23 2017|32|Like I said your end result will be you being forever alone Not my problem Not worth arguing Go on with your denial and have fun never having a relationship again deuces 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 00:36:32 2017|72| Specifics Read your post All of that There are plenty of wonderful reasonable men who say all sorts of things that aren t hateful toward women You re just not one of them Frankly though you arguing doesn t really matter because you re the one that will continue being alone So if that s your end goal you re doing a great job Just not sure why you posted about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 00:30:32 2017|21|There s a lot a guy who doesn t women wouldnt say And that includes pretty much everything you ve written 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 00:25:17 2017|9|Amazingly women prefer men who don t hate women 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 20:19:33 2017|10|Oh and here I thought this was a real post 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 20:17:11 2017|28|What health products are you referring to specifically I understand the problems surrounding birth control but I can t think of anything else that is hard to get 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 19:36:51 2017|59|I wouldn t consider it an alternate as my old username doesn t still exist and as it isn t a new one from being banned anywhere I ve never been banned from any sub actually since I tend to just leave if I don t like the content I do change my username about every six months though 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 19:29:51 2017|20|She disagrees with your opinion so she calls you a troll and reports everything you post That s her MO 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 19:28:58 2017|104|No it isn t For one you used Joss Whedon s bad WW script as a point The movie would have been successful regardless because people would have gone for Joss Whedon as he is a successful and popular director Some as what will happen with batgirl which is why he was chosen For two the article is talking about supposedly good female directors The director of Wonder Woman was not good Regardless of storyline or any of my feelings on its marketing her directing really was not good Add to that the terrible editing and it was difficult to watch in many places 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 18:48:04 2017|58|Probably This is like the 6th or 7th that I ve counted Someone has to have a really bad addiction to Reddit to keep ban evading like that I don t want to be harsh though because obviously there s not much else going on in that kind of person s life so I try to be sympathetic 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 18:38:21 2017|79|I don t rely on critics to supply my personal opinion on movies and a decent amount of viewers do agree with me Of course they didn t develop that opinion until after paying for and seeing the movie so box office numbers aren t quite a reliable thing Successful good It just means it was marketed well They knew touting it as feminist empowering to women would appeal to a large group of people but unfortunately they lied 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 18:34:09 2017|23|Nah I ve had many discussions with many other women who also were extremely disappointed with it Not as rare as you think 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 17:14:38 2017|53|Some of these movies and shows are very good but many of the directors are not names anyone would recognize People tend to be chosen for more than their direction ability for movies by large studios like DC and Joss Whedon is more of a household name than any of the people listed 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 16:43:50 2017|7|So was the movie that was made 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 16:43:00 2017|17|Did you see Wonder Woman Whatever clowns wrote and directed that aren t suited to direct either 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 16:35:50 2017|4|7 months not years 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 03:43:35 2017|27|I don t remember that part of Suicide Squad If you re talking about one frame in a comic book find something more substantial to complain about 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 21:24:52 2017|12|Strong disagree But he wasn t mentioned in this comment thread anyhow 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 21:17:57 2017|10|And shirtless Thor was definitely not meant to be sexy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 21:16:03 2017|13|Lol thousands of women would disagree with majority of those being non sexy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 20:32:07 2017|18|Yes often people use an example when discussing their point rather than listing every single instance of something 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 19:15:14 2017|14|Yea muscular men in tight clothes or shirtless definitely not meant to be sexy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 16:45:22 2017|23|Yea because the men in superhero movies totally aren t designed to look sexy and attractive Just women are getting that treatment s
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 07:34:56 2017|35|If she wasn t having sex at 21 there really wouldn t have been a need to get a pap I m sure some docs would suggest it but a lot would find it unnecessary 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 01:14:40 2017|5|False equivalence On my Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 00:37:01 2017|16|Yea The only people on edge are the ones who have been engaging in shitty behavior 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 22 23:27:48 2017|3|Why would they 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:17:32 2017|7|Oh so like a sorority Sounds cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:10:21 2017|2| Join feminism 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:07:40 2017|17|So a bunch of people I don t know or care about Heavens Whatever will I do 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:05:25 2017|13|Value to who 14 year olds like yourself I m okay with that 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:02:58 2017|12|He posts this like every couple days He s just ban evading 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:01:54 2017|26|Why do you post this every few days Men look way different by their late 20s too You will that find out in about 15 years 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 15:03:22 2017|3|Start using protection 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 06:46:13 2017|48|That links to the pic but not the post on mobile at least Not sure what it s about but if someone posts a pic of themselves on a sub like that it kind of opens them up to dumb comments But that s kind of the point 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 04:30:19 2017|50|Well you can work on losing weight and go to therapy Those two things should carry you through to your goal But be honest with yourself too 5 7 and 220lbs is obese Calling yourself not that fat is lying to yourself and that isn t the way to heal 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:45:07 2017|10|I just don t associate with any whiny MRAs methinks 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:40:58 2017|20|So it s not relevant to this sub Just like International Dog Day isn t relevant on the cat subreddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:37:49 2017|22|No I have not had any men in my life express that they have had gender specific problems that have gotten overlooked 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:34:35 2017|52|Why make it a pissing contest Everyone s got hardships You re free to talk about men s hardships on man based subreddits or basically any other subreddit that isn t for a specific group of people so go do that instead of pretending like you don t know you re trolling 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:32:31 2017|45| This day is important to me because I ve lost many male friends to suicide Sorry for your losses but it still isn t relevant on a woman s sub unless you re looking for our opinions of men in the context of our lives 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:31:07 2017|13|Awareness of what Men I am pretty sure we know that men exist 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:29:48 2017|25|But this is a woman s sub I don t go to a judaism sub and wish them a Merry Christmas It s just trolly 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:26:18 2017|37|Happy International Men s Day Though I don t think this post belongs here without any context of how it pertains to women Do you want us to talk about the men in our life or what 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 20:06:33 2017|36|You can say someone is awesome without painting others as less Stay at home moms are cool but they re no more or less heroic than those who don t have the luxury to stay home 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 17:17:05 2017|21|No one should be required to her anything this hypocritical walking sack of crap says She needs to be made irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 08:06:32 2017|23|You re arguing two completely separate points Stick to the one that I m actually talking about Actually it doesn t really matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:30:19 2017|24|I feel as though I don t give a shit what you think I ll form my solid opinion on it when it happens 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:27:53 2017|66|Do I really have to explain that to you Really Any dedicated person can care for feed sustain an infant If mom passes away and has someone else care for the little bean the baby will not die A zygote and a fetus are literally living off the woman s body and nutrients Like a parasite If the woman passes away the zygote fetus dies too 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:18:17 2017|23|I know it s the future but I m not going to form an opinion on something when it s not in practice 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:14:10 2017|25|I m sure there could b argument made in both directions but I don t really care much either way since it s a hypothetical 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:11:34 2017|62|It s beyond possession The zygote is literally being kept alive by the woman Men are incapable of sustaining that life So the entire life of it hinges completely on the woman not the man So no the choice is not equal But I mean even if you do want to use the word possession it s nine tenths of the law 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:03:21 2017|17|You asked why the father doesn t have an equal say in the abortion that s why 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:02:40 2017|11|No I haven t You just seem to lack reading comprehension 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:00:48 2017|97| In what sense is having an abortion taking responsibility They don t want to be pregnant and are taking the steps to deal with it That s taking responsibility Abortions aren t a light decision or a walk in the park for most women Given the hypothetical you think it s better to let a person bleed to death than forcefully take blood from the person who caused the bleeding in the first place It s better to honor everyone s bodily autonomy Someone doesn t lose their own just because they took someone else s away 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 06:54:50 2017|21|When men can carry a pregnancy and experience everything that comes along with it they can get equal day in it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 06:52:23 2017|41|If someone choosing to spend all the money on IVF and an artificial womb and then no longer wants the fetus I d guess they could put it up for adoption in utero and not have to sustain it any longer 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 06:46:18 2017|16|Having an abortion is taking responsibility And no no one should be forced to give blood 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 06:28:43 2017|20|Her body is the only thing keeping the zygote alive so it s her choice whether not to do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 05:10:46 2017|16|Wowza Both men and women can cheat By God you ve blown the case wide open 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 02:57:34 2017|20|She is still a horrible person No one should be giving her a platform to speak in the first place 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 01:13:39 2017|17|I dunno then My crowns were 1300 each for me so 1000 sounds like a good deal 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 01:08:15 2017|7|Maybe you didn t hit your deductible 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:31:04 2017|100| I ll just ignore and reportShe said as she replied to the comment I m definitely not a troll Someone disagreeing with you doesn t make them a troll You re acting like somehow saying Dunham is a horrible person is only valid when it comes from someone who you agree with on all other cases She s a hypocrite and she s trash I don t care if a man says it or a woman says it It s true and it doesn t deserve to be silenced just because some redditors hurt your feelings on some other issue 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:27:30 2017|79|And there s a sizable amount of people who aren t You re a redditor I m a redditor Ain t nothing hypocritical for me to call her a trash person so stop grouping everyone under the same blanket just because you don t like some of the commenters on this sub A broken clock is right twice a day I m not going to talk shit about that broken clock if it s currently displaying the correct time 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:24:26 2017|48|Funny how you deleted your comment defending Lena Dunham but now accuse everyone here of defending harassers and rapists on the daily Fairly certain at least half the commenters are women on this thread But let s just ignore those because they don t fit into your narrative 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:21:26 2017|81|I mean go ahead If someone in this thread is a known rapist or if they molested their kid sister please do point them out Not sure what the broad term of redditors millions of people with differing experiences and personalities has to do with whether or not it s okay to discuss the singular trash person that is Lea Dunham though But it just sounds like your grasping for straws now Sorry it hurts your feelings that she s garbage 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:12:16 2017|44|I mean they re commenting on her hypocrisy and how much a horrible person she is which is completely relevant when it s an article about her being a horrible hypocrite again Some are less eloquent than others but not everyone is a wordsmith 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:08:01 2017|16|The only trash heap is her Ain t nothing wrong with calling out a hypocritical celebrity 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:41:22 2017|13|I m sure but his opinion is equally as irrelevant as a troll 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:35:15 2017|10| principal sBut no I don t work in a school 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:25:46 2017|5|No I work with kiddos 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:25:24 2017|7|So then what s the issue here 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:06:36 2017|18|Only person in this entire thread that seems upset is you Do you need a safe space snowflake 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:04:56 2017|8|So does that make you a feminist then 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:03:44 2017|4|Why I m bored 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:03:30 2017|18|I know it s a troll I m waiting for my work day to finish so why not 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:00:23 2017|19|I don t see a reason why I should do that I m not the one who is upset 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 17 23:58:46 2017|4|Maybe get over it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 17 21:18:50 2017|61|Evry single person has done something incredibly shitty at some point in their lives That doesn t make them trash It makes them human How they deal with the fact that they ve done something shitty how they atone for it and whether or not they learn from it plays a huge factor in whether or not a person is trash 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 17 04:37:32 2017|25|Yes Because the only acceptable way to terminate a pregnancy is if a woman chooses for herself The killer has removed her ability to choose 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 13:37:41 2017|58|Sorry but regardless of how much she gets for a legal defense fund it is highly illegal to get a medical procedure performed on a child when you are not their guardian no matter what the procedure is Having a good lawyer doesn t change that fact Encouraging and arguing for someone to do this is extremely stupid 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 13:30:56 2017|32|Yea Tdap booster should happen every 10 years plus any time you ll be in regular close contact with a newborn The P in tdap is pertussis which is the whooping cough 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 13:25:09 2017|31|I m not agreeing or disagreeing with that I m simply saying what the commenter suggests is highly illegal and it s a terrible idea to tell OP to do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 03:21:31 2017|9|HIPAA And it s not a violation of that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 01:55:54 2017|71|You re not going to convince her with being rude confrontational calling her a dumbass or any of the other suggestions here No one responds positively to their viewpoint being met with aggression Her viewpoint is best met with empathy and understanding of her side followed by gently discussing facts with her Better yet find a pediatrician that she really likes who will nudge her in the right direction towards vaccines 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 01:51:26 2017|7|Cool yea OP get ready for jail 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 01:48:22 2017|61|The normal vaccine schedule has kids finished with most of their vaccines earlier than they can remember what happened to them Spreading them out just makes the kid associate The doctor with pain and negativity because they re getting shots every single time they re seen There s very little health risk in a normal child with getting vaccines on schedule 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 15 16:53:12 2017|32|Which is probably why he is asking people instead of saying Whatever she s overly sensitive Doesn t matter what she says He is literally doing what she asked him to do

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 20:26:48 2017|37|You re putting the cart before the horse Wait for your diagnosis and then go from there Diagnosing yourself with something that you don t even have the symptoms for is just creating unnecessary stress for yourself 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 20:12:46 2017|29|Urinary frequency and pelvic pain are signs of a UTI But you know what Don t get medical advice on the internet Go to a doctor with your concerns 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 20:07:36 2017|16|It sounds like a UTI Go to the doc for the right antibiotic to treat it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 16:06:41 2017|4|Yes you sound condescending 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 15:51:01 2017|22|You sound a little condescending about cultural norms in China Why are you living there if you think so lowly of them 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 02:36:14 2017|76|Sorry about your mom That s sad But it doesn t give you a right to bear judgement on others relationships with their mothers Parenting and grand parenting are two different ball games My mother dropped the ball a bunch as a mom and I have a lot of unresolved issues with her but she would be a fine grandparent so there s no reason why I d prevent my child from spending time with her 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 00:51:08 2017|17|Why should we play light and friendly with someone who comes boasting of their pretension and intelligence 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 00:11:43 2017|30|Reminds me of the whole you re not wrong or I don t disagree thing It really is so hard for people to say you re right or I agree 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 00:06:54 2017|22|Then maybe you should hold off on announcing that you re so smart so you lack a very important form of intelligence 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 00:00:52 2017|10|Saying you feel stupid around someone isn t a compliment 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 16:58:14 2017|10|Yea There are hundreds of studies on nature vs nurture 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 16:21:07 2017|25|No it s not and I m not going to continue this conversation when you re clearly trying to skew my words Get a life 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 16:01:22 2017|19|I have not in any way excused his actions or made any claims that what he did was okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 08:45:33 2017|47|You only came here to try and validate his actions You re not interested in learning anything In other words you re just trolling He even agrees that what he did was wrong He s not looking for some socially inept rando to vindicate him on Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 08:02:09 2017|19|Explaining consent to people who are purposefully obtuse is a waste of time You damn well know the difference 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 07:50:34 2017|10|Just speaking into the ether but if the shoe fits 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 07:46:04 2017|39|I was surprised at first to see how many people are incapable of grasping the concept of actual consent vs being pressured into something but then I remembered that Reddit banned Incels so they ve migrated to other areas 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 23:44:26 2017|19| any other accusers yetAt any rate not sure what that has to do with MLK being a good guy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 18:52:35 2017|9|Yea I would definitely call MLK as swell guy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 18:49:50 2017|18|Somehow I don t think infidelity belongs on the same list as child rape physical abuse and murder 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 17:35:48 2017|139| My point is that I don t care that he apologized He did a bad thing that he knew was bad And my point is why I don t see a reason to treat someone who actually did take accountability for their actions in the same way as the large swath of people who haven t When you harass women like that you don t just get a free pass after saying sorry What free pass is he getting You can still be disapproving and disgusted of what someone did while being open to their promises of growing as a person and never doing stuff like that again I have 0 sympathy for him I don t have sympathy for him either but I do think people deserve to be given a chance to make good on their word 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 17:23:35 2017|105|I don t see people beyond anti woman dummies who don t even deserve the time of day excusing his actions but at some point when a person apologizes takes accountability for their actions and is prepared to deal with the consequences we can stop crucifying them What he did was gross and creepy 100 But he admitted to it yes it should have been sooner and if he is genuine in his dedication to take steps to stop talking and listen I think he deserves a chance to atone for his transgression So I m tentatively on the side of not completely boycotting him 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 16:24:03 2017|13|He masturbated to completion in front of the two women who were together 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 01:55:15 2017|61|As I said it will be hard to prove he did anything illegal Regardless of the admission that he did do it it s he said she said about what led up to it and there s been no talk of anyone telling him to stop Abuse of power absolutely but prosecutable Meh Probably just a waste of time and money 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 01:45:13 2017|72|Hey I m not defending what he did at all Totally creepy Legality wise I don t think it would be easy to prove that he did anything illegal though That s all I m saying I respect that he took accountability apologized and made a vow to stop talking and listen instead It doesn t undo what he did but it s a good start for the women to begin healing 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 01:17:46 2017|40|It actually seems from what everyone says including the women involved he did get consent It s just that the duo of women thought he was kidding and at least one other just didn t think she could say no 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 10 01:09:31 2017|33| Is it such a crime to want someone to reproduce A crime No But it s really not anyone s business but the person who is choosing whether or not to do it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 10 00:42:42 2017|146|I do think women get more pressure as far as children go but to claim that nobody does it to men isn t accurate either Men also get a lot of attempted dissuasion about vasectomies You just don t experience it because you aren t a man Anecdotally I ve run into a lot more acceptance of not having children than pushback Of course there will always be nosy people but I don t see why I should let them bother me Equally as annoying to me are people that go on and on about how oppressed they are for being childfree And people who are rude and condescending towards those who choose to be parents Everyone should just live their dang lives the way they want without someone else being an ass to them for choosing to do it differently than what they d choose 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  9 22:46:59 2017|17|Men s definition of man hating is a lot different than women s definition of woman hating 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  9 03:16:12 2017|19|It s too bad it took DT getting elected to get people to get off their asses and vote 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 22:18:50 2017|8|K changed my comment just for you 3
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 22:13:36 2017|45|No this was more than a year and at least one phone ago and I didn t really give a crap about it by the next day other than that I thought the fact that I was the one that got suspended was pretty lame 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 22:07:21 2017|19|No I don t want to talk about this and no I am not misinformed Have a good day 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 22:03:56 2017|45| I don t support people that act like that nor will I give them a voice to spew that kind of vitriol And yet you identify as an MRA I m fine lumping those people together because they re two sides of the same coin 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 20:42:34 2017|38|I mean they re my opinions If I thought my opinions were wrong I would change them But I don t So I won t So again I don t care what he or you has to say 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 20:05:41 2017|22|Again I don t care about your opinion on feminism I don t have to defend it to you You are irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 20:04:38 2017|11|Okay I don t care Didn t I already say that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 20:02:56 2017|35|No they don t They want to invalidate women s experiences and tell them how much worse men have it I m fine with equality between the sexes That s why I subscribe to MensLib 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 19:57:31 2017|10|Then why was it a response to my parent comment 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 19:56:44 2017|28|I don t personally care if you take me seriously or not Most MRAs are just incels that occasionally find a women who is willing to fuck them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 19:55:33 2017|1|Yup 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 19:12:44 2017|15|I m sorry I m not sure how that s related to what I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 18:04:52 2017|197|I mean I get that the admins are just trying to improve their public image Especially considering Reddit spawned Elliott Rodger Dylan Rooffe and others But it s not like those people are going to disappear They re just going to congregate in other subs that don t explicitly promote violence against women like MensRights and MGTOW and continue with their toxicity Any time I ve reported PMs from men who have said things like I d like to put you through a meat grinder feet first so I can see you suffer and die nothing has come of it Those accounts still exist and still post their horrible stuff And the one time a few years ago I posted a screen shot of a dude s PMs where he threatened to rape me because I identified as a feminist in reply to his comments I got my account suspended for spam They like to have their public facing stuff seem like they re actually against this stuff but in reality they give zero fucks and then try to act surprised when they spawn another misogynist piece of shit who murders women for not giving him sex 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov  6 03:54:33 2017|91|Her dresses aren t different from any other dresses her fellow anchors wear She fills them out differently because she s curvier You seem to have an unconscious bias against her which is unfortunate It seems a bit tinged with racism but that s for you to reflect on which I doubt you will do But in the end she s the one who is looking awesome and gets to do what she loves while you re complaining about her on Reddit so frankly I don t need to defend her 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov  6 03:43:33 2017|17|A news anchor wearing a fitted dress is not akin to wearing a bikini at a library 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov  6 03:36:23 2017|49|So then what s the problem here She can wear what she wants to work as long as it isn t breaking dress code You specifically bring up dress code It s not breaking dress code so I am not sure what you re fussing about to be honest 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov  6 03:31:08 2017|22|Clearly if she is allowed to wear what she wears it isn t breaking the dress code at her place of work 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 22:28:17 2017|17|It doesn t have to be thanksgiving to cook a turkey Freeze the leftovers Eat for weeks 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 19:06:42 2017|1|Yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 17:44:09 2017|51|She gets banned or suspended and then creates new usernames to ban evade but it s glaringly obvious who she is It s like yea you re really pulling a fast one by making a new username immediately and continuing to post I think it borders on addiction at this point 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 16:39:26 2017|10|You somehow made this woman s situation entirely about you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 06:17:59 2017|29|Because society puts a large emphasis on the importance of being beautiful As far as the body of your text goes I have no idea what it even says 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 06:15:48 2017|9|How on earth do people this fragile even exist 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 18:10:11 2017|21|Terribly acted Why does this exist How would people in a close knit group of friends not know she was single 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 16:04:45 2017|81|If you want to reply to things you need to press reply and type it in the box You are making new parent comments I can almost guarantee he would take the piss out of a boy the same way I m all for pointing out sexism and calling out rape culture but this ain t it Honestly the people harping about trivial stuff like this and using mental gymnastics to be offended tends to remove the gravity from actual complaints 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 15:02:56 2017|35|Why does the kid being black make it worse At any rate that seemed all in good fun Like when you have a little cousin and they say the opposite sex has cooties Just teasing 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 06:22:28 2017|16|Whereas I don t find either to be a big deal Diff rent Strokes theme song 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 06:17:09 2017|64|Honestly as far as something like this goes I have experienced women doing this much more often The line for the ladies room is too long so they just go to the men s room and act like it s no big deal But if a man using the ladies room is a big deal then so is the opposite Invasion of privacy etc 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:48:45 2017|12|For someone going their own way they sure are focused on women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  1 04:34:08 2017|19| Asians are the most racist peoples with a hierarchy that puts Japanese in first place Only to the Japanese 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Oct 30 20:58:34 2017|25|That would be ideal but unfortunately unrealistic But people can protect themselves while we work towards a better world where they don t need protection 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Oct 30 14:57:33 2017|8|Are you getting it in your inner thigh 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Oct 30 06:46:05 2017|82|I don t think servers need any more hostility over trivial things than they already get My boyfriend and I had a conversation earlier about how we can tell if someone has been in the service industry or not I m fairly certain you would be in the not column Show a little empathy They ve got a lot to deal with and generally just give the check to whoever asked for it or place it in the middle of the table 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Oct 30 06:33:58 2017|8|Likely more exposure to different strains of HPV 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Oct 29 15:28:30 2017|63|In this case they re just trying to emulate strong girl heros not necessarily the culture they happen to be from Kids LOVE Doc McStuffins and a lot of little girls want to be her for Halloween As long as they re not thrown into blackface I don t see the harm They re admiring and emulating her not her race or culture 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Oct 29 03:28:14 2017|24|I d like to think most people who are looking to settle down with a person are considering more than just their sexual prowess 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Oct 28 06:55:04 2017|66|The health at any size movement is predominantly female yes I wish it could be happiness at any size though Be happy with yourself regardless of the things you want need to improve Work to improve them but don t hate yourself during your journey You re still worthy of love and respect and self love as a human being no matter what you look like 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Oct 28 06:44:53 2017|6|Saturday night Where do you live 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Oct 28 05:55:19 2017|10|OP hasn t commented on this post at all though 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:34:32 2017|21|I m literally using the exact language she used in her title just repeating it with my opinion instead of hers 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:28:15 2017|14|Putting her friend on blast isn t the way to be genuine or heartfelt 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:27:46 2017|23|Looks like we disagree I don t feel like repeating myself again so you can just read my last comment Happy New Year 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:21:54 2017|49|Because the main reason people are doing what her friend is doing is because of what the shitty rich people have done I m not going to berate people who are victims of society They are a symptom I m going to go after the cause of the problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:19:07 2017|18|So why is she allowed to share her opinion but I can t share my response to it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:15:04 2017|12|I edited it immediately after sending it I pressed send too quickly 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:10:29 2017|24|I think universal healthcare should be a thing so I don t have an issue with contributing to the payment of others hospital bills 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 22:08:07 2017|31|I did read it I just don t see why she thinks she would be automatically offered a job at a lower level especially if she didn t apply for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:50:08 2017|13|No I m just someone who doesn t meddle in others life affairs 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:49:36 2017|16|I don t but I don t care how other people choose to live their lives 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:36:04 2017|16|Stop telling other people how to live their lives in 2018 Mind your own damn business 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:33:43 2017|9|How is it logical to give someone a demotion 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 21:18:19 2017|12|Well why would she get a job she didn t apply for 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 19:48:22 2017|7|Did you apply for your old position 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 06:52:44 2017|11|The right to live their lives without those kinds of inconveniences 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 06:38:44 2017|23|We could have female legislators continually try to pass laws that make it difficult for men to obtain condoms and maintain bodily autonomy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 06:12:28 2017|21|Because women still need to be brought to a level playing field with men before we concentrate on keeping everything equal 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 05:32:38 2017|6|This sounds pretty normal to me 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 30 10:17:02 2017|8|Then why did you set up a date 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 30 10:09:59 2017|16|And you met him while he was working and spoke to him while he was working 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 30 10:06:23 2017|44|How on earth can you know that from texting He probably just doesn t like sitting around texting That is boring Though I suppose in that case you should cancel the date because he might not be interested in constantly texting and you are 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 30 09:36:18 2017|25|Uh so wait why are you cancelling the date Because he had a long day and didn t want to text you through the night 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 19:09:48 2017|4|Again you re welcome 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 19:06:05 2017|1|Right 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:59:42 2017|14|I m not bothered I just don t think childish behavior should be applauded 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:58:06 2017|10|Just replace the cookies and tell her you ate them 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:51:14 2017|29|There are more positive ways to lighten the weight of it all than doing this Go on a nice walk Find a new hobby Volunteer at an animal shelter 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:41:15 2017|40|I don t think acting like a child is something to brag about If you re going to act like that then that s your choice But why post on here like it s something you re proud of doing 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 18:31:10 2017|10|Ignoring him is probably more effective than giving him attention 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 17:31:14 2017|117|Honestly if you feel having an abortion will harm your mental health more than being pregnant you can follow through with the pregnancy and put the baby up for adoption It s not ideal but at least the baby will have a stabile environment once it s out of the womb My personal opinion is that due to your addiction and a non supportive partner it might be best to get an abortion but no one should be making that decision for you Don t let people tell you that you re a bad person or that you are wrong for choosing to abort and don t let them do that if you choose not to abort 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 03:07:44 2017|24|That s a pretty normal goodbye gesture much like a handshake IMO unless you re describing something completely different than what I m imagining 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 02:06:41 2017|32|If you re wife is the one who doesn t like guns and she said not to make it a thing I don t know why you aren t listening to her 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 29 00:22:38 2017|7|He asked her and she said yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 21:46:22 2017|6|Ain t nothing wrong with sarcasm 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 17:47:36 2017|29|pile of garbage unfortunately used as fuel by MRAs and the like to find weak spots and hypocrisy in feminism since as if she s the spokesperson for women 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 12:07:31 2017|44|I don t care If a 30 year old is capable of being around a typical 18 year old for an extended amount of time without going completely insane he is likely extremely immature for his age and should probably be dating younger anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 12:05:36 2017|46|Wow This is next level what about is They can write an article discussing why this girl is incredible without saying Malala gets all the attention It s always Malala Malala Malala Leave her out of it She deserves the attention and praise she has gotten 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 28 11:58:17 2017|18|Wouldn t a positive experience be I did not get pregnant and have to go get an abortion

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 20:27:04 2017|4|What did they do 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 16:42:14 2017|58|I d never expect my partner to stay home with me when I m sick unless I was truly incapacitated and unable to to move or function without assistance You re on Reddit which means that isn t the case I think the care package was very nice of him and he isn t being inconsiderate by going 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 05:01:56 2017|34|As I said there are a lot of options between the two and you re going to have a hard time finding a doctor who will jump to that extreme procedure before trying them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 04:56:11 2017|1|125 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 04:51:54 2017|44|There are a lot of steps between replace my IUD and remove my uterus Regardless of your age be taking that into account ESPECIALLY because of your age there are very few doctors that would jump to something so severe and with good reason 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 26 23:22:51 2017|28|Gamer dudes whine and complain about women not wanting to date them that seems to be enough proof that there are people who don t find gaming attractive 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 26 01:22:01 2017|39|It s not an attractive hobby to a lot of people Nothing wrong wi that Edit uh oh someone s feelings are hurt Sorry not gaming isn t a hobby that is attractive to some people Get over it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 23:57:53 2017|8|It s just an addiction like anything else 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 20:03:22 2017|64|If you re too sick to leave the house you re too sick to leave the house If there are conditions which you would leave the house then you aren t too sick to leave the house You aren t going because you don t want to go It s fine to not want to go but claiming you are too sick is inconsistent 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 19:53:44 2017|75|Sounds like typical family drama and your mom sounds kinda jerky but if I hadn t and I was sick I would ve definitely went today regardless of how I feltIf you re so sick you can t possibly go today why would you magically not be too sick to go in this other scenario It s inconsistent and makes it seem like you aren t going just because you don t feel like it

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 01:20:50 2017|61|I m not evading it I don t address and argue about unrealistic what ifs for real life situations He s not arguing any point because false premises are not points If there isn t a child there isn t a child to get custody of But we could keep repeating ourselves over and over if you want That seems productive 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 25 01:05:11 2017|55|He asked about if the guy wants the child A child has to first exist for him to be able to say he wants it If she has an abortion there is no child and there never was I don t make the rules of biology and I don t argue hypotheticals That is unreasonable 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 23:48:23 2017|9|If she had an abortion there is no child 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 23:21:33 2017|18|If he wants the child he can go to court and get partial or full custody of it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 22:42:01 2017|51|Disagree After the child is born it deserves to have support It s no longer simply a medical decision for one person If the mother can financially support it in her own then that s fine But if it needs supplemental support the father is one that needs to provide it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 22:38:24 2017|7|Depends on the situation but usually yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 22:22:05 2017|11|No one deserves any power over anyone else s medical decisions

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 16:04:12 2017|14|Be competent and most people will treat you as competent Not all but most 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 16:03:01 2017|2| r thathappened
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 24 06:08:53 2017|10|The gays don t have ownership of the term partner 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 22:58:18 2017|6|How far along would you be 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 20:27:04 2017|30|Absolutely not Unless she wants to reveal what a petty manipulative score keeper she is Though my guess is if they ve been together six years he already knows it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 19:56:10 2017|58|I think it s good that he recognizes its origins and there s nothing wrong with him telling you his opinion Obviously it s your prerogative as to whether you will shave or not but he sounds like a pretty good dude and if I were in your position I personally would probably give this one to him 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 17:19:42 2017|6|Utis aren t in the vagina 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 16:52:46 2017|20|Is English your second language or I could try explaining it in other terms since this seems confusing for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 16:44:33 2017|6|What part of this lacks that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 13:43:14 2017|47|None of those situations you mentioned grinning and bearing it involve you having to deal with people insulting and abusing you for his sake do they You literally say in the description that you didn t mind doing them Well he minds doing this so respect that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 13:29:17 2017|104|If you feel okay going that s your business but expecting him to go after your family was rude to him is out of line and unsupportive Did they apologize to him and to you for the comments It is completely within reason that he avoids them and for you to accuse him of not supporting you because he won t stand for abuse from your family doesn t shine a very nice light on you as a partner Also your theatrics just sound manipulative If this is causing such and over the top response I think you need to find a good therapist 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 13:05:13 2017|23|I don t either but you keep acting like having the desire to do so is repulsive and disgusting so here we are 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 12:56:04 2017|24|Pretty sure not kissing a baby despite wanting to kiss a baby is having functional boundaries but thanks for the low key condescension anyway 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 12:54:26 2017|6|Are you the thought police now 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 05:11:00 2017|14|It s not unheard of but in this instance she is being super dramatic 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 04:32:18 2017|12|You can unmatch and block them Staying matched with someone implies interest 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 04:03:02 2017|37|So you were talking to a guy then didn t talk to him for a while but stayed matched wi him and it is terrifying that he asked what was up and whether you were still interested 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 03:30:35 2017|17|Thinking is fine Doing is the problem Those little guys are just so cute and kissable looking 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 02:35:40 2017|29|I m not saying they should do it but to act like it is a disgusting to even think of kissing a baby is a bit over the top 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 01:57:26 2017|27|I dunno how many babies you ve held but sometimes it takes a lot of restraint to not give a baby a smooch They re so cute 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 01:41:24 2017|47|I d just have a no adults kissing the baby rule period Considering how prolific herpes is not to mention other illnesses that s just the safest route and it doesn t single out one friend I have serious doubts she s your only friend with herpes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 01:13:00 2017|109|It sounds like he just doesn t like his job and feels it was a lot of time and money put into something with little reward Honestly from my experience being a nurse gives you more patient time which is a good and bad and is a really good job for someone with good social skills Because it s very focused around patient interaction A lot of doctors lack that because they ve focused so hard on their trade So they can do the specific thing they went to school for very well but have trouble in other areas of their lives Nurses tend to be more well rounded 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 23 01:09:00 2017|24|That s what dating is for You get to know someone to see if you re compatible If you aren t you stop dating 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 19:29:25 2017|8|It s like the Iranian version of Footloose 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 16:12:39 2017|13|If 115lbs was a healthy weight for her she is likely pretty short 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 16:08:55 2017|27|I don t think it s a bad idea but I definitely understand how it could be a problem for people who can t afford that upfront 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:55:23 2017|20|That s interesting I ve never heard of it but I ve only worked in three clinics in my career 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:54:27 2017|24|Yea I don t think shaming is the right word here though I don t think it was appropriate for her to say anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:53:35 2017|22|It s actually retail 101 to not comment on customer s purchases when working in a place such as a drug store 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:51:36 2017|6|You can sit down to pee 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 15:01:30 2017|70|I feel like being aggressive toward a partner when they ask a question you don t like isn t the way to keep a happy relationship Explaining why you don t think the question is appropriate and hopefully coming to an understanding is probably a better route I d hate to be with a person that gives such a terse and dickish answer when I try to ask them something 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 05:31:07 2017|23|I never kept count and I don t discuss something like that with my partner so I have never lied about it before 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec 22 04:20:32 2017|1|what 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 20 01:22:04 2017|24|Are you implying that men dying alone in their houses after falling is a big problem but that it doesn t happen to women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 20 00:52:33 2017|60|No you just say in the post that she doesn t lock her phone That doesn t give anyone including you a right to look at her texts without her permission If you don t think it s a big deal why don t you tell her Sounds like you know she ll be mad that you invaded her privacy 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 20 00:47:23 2017|19|I think it s important that she knows you think it s okay to invade her privacy like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 20 00:34:41 2017|17|Why don t you tell your girlfriend you snooped through her phone and take it from there 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 23:27:28 2017|7|Why can t you leave your house 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 23:17:35 2017|22|You should probably just mind your business and get over it considering you haven t even worked there for over a year 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 23:14:03 2017|17|Maybe get a life alert thing That way you will be able to get help if needed 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 21:25:04 2017|8|I have never been choked by TJ Miller 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 19 18:43:32 2017|19|It sounds like he was passing down advice from what he learned when he was new to the job 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 22:13:53 2017|15|So then wouldn t that be equally unfair to the men in the company too 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 18:40:30 2017|58|I m talking about the woman you re agreeing with At any rate yea when you have general info the best to give is general advice which is it is completely circumstantial and there is not one right way to choose not being a stay at home parent is a stupid choice and you ll end up poor 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 18:15:48 2017|22|You and your buddy keep making these sweeping generalizations about things when you have no idea about each person s individual situation 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 17:32:50 2017|29|No I m pretty sure the idea that having children isn t a one size fits all thing is a good argument regardless of the age of the children 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:47:50 2017|32|I mean if you re comfortable being an asshole who doesn t take sexual harassment seriously there s no magic words that will change that So I guess just keep sucking Peace 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:38:01 2017|71|There isn t anyone who is going to suddenly stop believing victims because they disagree with what one celebrity says If one person s opinion on harassment is enough to make you dubious of anyone that comes forward with allegations you were already on the wrong side of the debate to begin with you were just looking for an easy scapegoat in order to begin your overt defense of shitty behavior 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:30:41 2017|126| When she attacked Matt Damon for saying we should look at these cases on the contents of the actions and not judge all of them the same she is shattering any reasonable definition of what is what Wow Rose McGowan sure has a lot of power over you if you think she can change the definition of words Did she change her last name to McGowan from Merriam Webster when she got famous or something That means that when you say harassment now people will think of things that most don t see as harassment and nobody will care Wait What You mean to tell me people will doubt when a victim speaks out about sexual assault or harassment No way Real change of pace there 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:24:07 2017|11|What does she have to do with me not condoning harassment 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 07:18:29 2017|7|Who is she making a fool of 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 05:28:05 2017|28|In a lot of areas it s a more financially sound choice to have a stay at home parent and paying for childcare is the bigger financial sacrifice 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 04:24:03 2017|73|The fact that you had to give up your friends for him should have been your first red flag It s time to stop making excuses on why you can t leave him This isn t the first time you ve made a post bitching about him You delete them and then a few days later make another one You re responsible for making your life better Complaining does nothing Make it better 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 03:33:04 2017|18|So then break up with him You don t even like him so why are you with him 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 18 03:08:12 2017|63|I kind of think it depends on what the present was Like if they got you a Bookshelf and he was putting it together for you that s kind of sweet If it was a puzzle that s kind of shitty Either way it s just something to talk about Dwelling on it and making it a big deal doesn t help anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 16 18:20:37 2017|34|Some of these things listed in the article are legit struggles but some of them are eye rollingly incelly and entitled All in all the article breaks even and doesn t really accomplish anything 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 16 03:51:01 2017|23|No it isn t Some people don t feel the need to document everything with pictures Some people prefer to just experience it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 14 18:26:59 2017|23|Many of these movies are just terrible chick flick or not Breakfast at Tiffany s is epically racist I ll give them that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 14 06:20:27 2017|23|You have his name and social media account You don t need to stalk him or your sister Let her live her life 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec 14 06:01:59 2017|38|Is your sister and adult without any mental delays Then let her make her own decisions and stop meddling Ask her to give you the address where she will be staying and beyond that mind your own business 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 13 22:56:25 2017|13|Why are you telling her what her boundaries should be in her relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 13 04:21:42 2017|20|Alabaman white people are apparently if they thought a child molester was a good choice of Senate which they did 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 13 00:24:02 2017|26|Yes I think we ve established that some people disagree with me Everyone s entitled to their opinion I don t think it s relevant here 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 13 00:14:46 2017|31|I have no issues with men I just don t think any article about men belongs on a woman s subreddit just because there is a blurb about women in it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 12 23:38:18 2017|26|I think an article specifically about that rather than an article based around men and the problems men face would be more relevant for this sub 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 12 23:20:45 2017|20|Yes I did read the article which is why I said it seems more suitable for a men s subreddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec 12 22:40:51 2017|11|more suitable for a man s subreddit don t you think 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 11 05:15:09 2017|31|It s likely that her constant visits seem to them as drug seeking behavior Is she seeing an orthopedist or is she going to the ER every time she gets hurt 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Dec 11 00:21:54 2017|46|I mean they share a wall I would be surprised if she didn t hear less than yelling sometimes That doesn t make it abuse I can hear when my neighbor yells to his wife in the other room It depends on what is being said 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 10 16:25:26 2017|72|I actually also have celiac and have a gf baking business on the side But what you are sourcing says that GF replacement products are bad for you which is absolutely true but no one needs to be eating those products though it s nice that they do since it makes me money Eating a nutrient rich diet of plenty fruits veggies meats nuts etc is a totally fine way to live 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 10 16:08:46 2017|45|What It isn t unhealthy to eat gluten free without an intolerance It just isn t necessary No one needs to eat gluten and no one is going to suffer any vitamin deficiencies from not eating it There s just no reason to completely abstain 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 10 04:36:52 2017|7|I think this belongs in r thinlydisguisedrants
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 19:24:16 2017|38|Your post was shitty to begin with And no there s a reason things require an exam before diagnosis But I guess keep pretending to be a doctor on Reddit if that s what you like to do 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 19:06:33 2017|23|Yea no Someone who is medically trained knows better than to make a presumptuous conclusion about a person they see on the street 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 18:08:20 2017|11|How do you know she s not just a thin person 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 04:48:17 2017|8|Maybe you should have worn a condom then 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Dec  8 04:47:07 2017|15|Glad you re okay but what does this have to do with being a woman 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:36:22 2017|6|Better start saving up short stuff 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:36:07 2017|15|Because you re incredibly immature and if you are an adult that s a problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:23:34 2017|4|Yea you do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:20:40 2017|32|Saying someone is too short for his tastes is about the most benign and least insulting critique I ve heard I hope you are a teenager because if not this is absurd 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 16:18:16 2017|18|Okay fine whatever You re too short Yup End of the world What are you going to do 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:57:30 2017|27|He said you were short for his tastes Grow up and get over it You re making this into a thing when it really doesn t matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:49:48 2017|17|Because you re implying that only super tall men can like taller women Everyone can have preferences 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:46:17 2017|3|Why are yu
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:27:15 2017|43|The world average takes into account Asian countries where the height is a lot shorter than most other areas I assumed you were in the US My mistake But either way dude doesn t want to date you so it s pretty irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:11:30 2017|27|Disliking and avoiding over half the population based on preconceived notions is the sign of a person who doesn t reflect on their own flaws very well 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Dec  7 15:08:03 2017|9|It s average He probably just prefers tall women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 19:41:15 2017|5|Odd how your tone changed 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 19:04:33 2017|25|I didn t say anything about this post cupcake Dude made a generalization about the women on this sub so I did it right back 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 16:14:51 2017|22| and more than half the men are MRA shit bags who try to undermine anything women say so what s your point 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 05:54:21 2017|36|Yea I totally believe you At any rate patients don t appreciate ambiguous answers They aren t satisfied with vague cop outs So they re going to be pissed either way Might as well be honest 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 05:44:48 2017|13|You work in the medical field but ask medical questions on Reddit K 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 05:36:52 2017|7|Do you work in the medical field 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 03:55:53 2017|79|As far as your idea that he s gotten so much backing you ve got confirmation bias He has received a lot of criticism too And no there s no way that you can say any of this without sounding shitty You re doing whataboutism while complaining about whataboutism You re upset that a guy who got sexually assault is getting support This isn t a pissing contest Anyone receiving support after a sexual assault is a good thing 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 03:44:17 2017|57|No I m not uncomfortable with people being supportive of Terry Crews He deserves all the support he is getting Just because other people also deserve support and belief doesn t make his any less important And the poor guy has been getting a lot of hate and discrimination too Because he is a big black man 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 03:26:35 2017|65| I don t know manNot a man I think the potential for negative public backlash is WAY higher with this than just generally being unavailable It s about equal either way but at least he s being honest Most people want to know why their doctor decided to pawn them off on another person and giving an ambiguous reason will just piss them off more 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec  5 23:17:05 2017|78| It seems unprofessional because it s giving out his personal information possibly without his consent Why do you think it is without his consent I think just saying he s unavailable or dealing with another patient neither of which is exactly a lie would be more appropriate Which could also cause a negative Yelp review People will find any reason to complain about a doctor Better to be transparent about the reason than to give something so ambiguous 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec  5 19:24:18 2017|50|I wouldn t equate that with a company donating specifically to him It s like if someone sells guns to a person who then commits a mass shooting Should they take some responsibility for selling those guns Of course Would I say that literally murdered those people Not so sure 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Dec  5 18:43:23 2017|15|It looks like they donated to the RNC not to Roy Moore s campaign specifically

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:49:03 2017|19|Don t try to blame your backwards thinking on being a man Plenty of men don t advocate abuse 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:38:49 2017|16|He pushed her to get her away from the door when she was trying to leave 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:34:23 2017|36|He literally physically abused her Even if you for some stupid reason don t think his other behavior was abusive I m not sure how physical abuse doesn t go under the abuse column for you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:22:21 2017|46|No most guys don t do that Don t try to legitimize your abusive behavior just because you were able to manipulate your partner into thinking it s normal My condolences to your wife and the children you are raising I hope they somehow learn better 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec  2 16:18:13 2017|15|You need to talk to your parents and have them find you a good therapist 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 20:59:07 2017|50|No there is never a need for aggression regardless of gender Teaching little girls that being an asshole is okay as long as you get your way is not progressive Making boundaries and keeping them is absolutely fine Maxine Waters is a great example of this Never aggressive Always assertive 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 20:32:40 2017|8|No Be assertive Aggression is never the answer 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 15:24:39 2017|20|Broken clock is right twice a day I m not going to piss and moan about it when it is 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 15:04:06 2017|44|No Lena Dunham is cancer Women need to stop defending her just because she s a woman I am a woman and I love and appreciate women but she doesn t deserve any respect regardless of how you want to rationalize her shitty behavior 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 14:59:21 2017|20|Defending rapists and diddling your kid sister is probably advancing society a lot less than calling someone out for it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 30 00:07:11 2017|22|You know what forget it Yes You will be like this for your entire life because you are too stubborn to listen 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:54:08 2017|43|You re making the conscious choice to do that You know you re doing wrong and you won t do anything to make it right That s your choice You are choosing to live the rest of your life as a shit bag 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:52:51 2017|20|Then keep having a horrible life where you constantly feel like shit I guess Best of luck with all that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:49:21 2017|8|There you go with your manipulative language again 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:47:59 2017|18|So you re just milking their time rather than both their time and money Very magnanimous of you 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:36:03 2017|33|I read the comments before you posted it though there were few and all of them had advice It s still advice even when you don t like it and hurts your feelings 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:29:22 2017|52|Don t do shitty stuff and people won t put you down for doing shitty stuff People gave you advice You claimed you can t do it and then shifted straight to guess I ll kill myself mode Go get therapy You ll learn exactly how manipulative your words and actions are 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:13:38 2017|68|People at criticizing you and instead of reflecting on what they re saying you are playing the victim card with your Guess I ll just kill myself stuff Don t ask for advice if you re just going to whine about it You put yourself in the situation and you can get out of it You just don t want to put in the effort to do it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 23:10:00 2017|15|So on top of all you listed in the post you re also manipulative Cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 02:17:14 2017|14|But what does that have to do with her changing last name or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 01:11:55 2017|23|I don t understand why him being an only child is relevant in this Are you wanting him to change his last name 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 01:07:07 2017|72|It s your choice where you threshold is for political differences No one else can decide that for you What worries me the most about this is what happens if an accidental pregnancy were to occur Would he support me He d support you in keeping it it seems like Although it wouldn t be all that unusual for someone to manipulate a person into keeping a kid and then leaving them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 29 00:12:19 2017|26|It s actually a good core strengthening move I think the anxiety and illness are more closely associated with your issue than holding in your stomach 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 21:06:52 2017|27|Ehhhhhh I dunno about that I wouldn t consider the guy who voiced Aladdin automatically relevant in modern day just because he played a character I liked 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 20:49:01 2017|9|Beauty and the Beast was made in 94 though 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 19:58:42 2017|33|I m dismissing her viewpoint because it s stupid and outdated baselessOh is she somehow relevant What has she done recently that makes her a voice of importance in this day and age 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 19:43:30 2017|53| Legally HIPPA I am surprised about how many people on Reddit are such experts on HIPAA yet don t the proper acronym I would not worry about it It is not illegal to do what you did It is not a crimeYes it is illegal to operate a motor vehicle under the influence 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 17:26:40 2017|75|Sometimes And sometimes not But it s odd that some people here are the thought police It sounds like these people were having a drunken candid conversation If they re calling her up and telling her they re fantasizing about her or bring it up every time they see her I can understand the aversion But this strikes me as a drunken conversation that traveled to that neck of the woods not a regular occurrence 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 15:45:05 2017|18|A story about them would probably be more useful than giving a voice to someone irrelevant and powerless 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 15:05:32 2017|8|Old person has outdated views Story at 11 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 10:19:43 2017|6|Confessing dumb stuff during drunken banter 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 04:47:25 2017|22|Then I reckon you should change the wording of the body of your text And then also get the fuck over it

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 02:31:32 2017|20|You seem to be underweight and malnourished Eating a balanced diet is a good start to getting back on track 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 28 02:29:48 2017|52|They view attractive women sexually If they re not doing or saying anything to you that is inappropriate best to just forget it But it s it really a gender divide as far as this goes Many women fantasize about attractive men too Being in a relationship doesn t make us blind 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 06:16:36 2017|2|That good 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 05:00:37 2017|35| November 26 2017 The day we beat sexism by convincing op to call her bank Remember the date November 26 2017 The day we beat sexism by griping about it on reddit Remember the date 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 04:50:27 2017|164| Opposed to what ignoring it Do you think they need reddit s expert advice on how to contact their bank and ask them to address mail to the mortgage holder Apparently so considering they haven t done it yet and this isn t the first time it has happened according to OP I know I d be livid And if you read the rest of the comments some people answered her question As did I I m a woman who owns a home and have not had this happen to me despite having an obviously female name Getting the name changed should be easy And yet they haven t done it Addressing the root problem seems to be the point of the thread Yes and We are in the future now It has already happened They can t go back in time and ensure that they know Leigh is a man or change the history of sexism They can only act from the present 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 04:45:03 2017|6|That s what it sounds like 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 04:27:08 2017|42| The letter should be address to him and him only Even if they think he is a woman but it isn t So he needs to contact them and them know they shouldn t be sending mail addressed to anyone but him 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 27 03:41:32 2017|149| She made a conscious effort not to include me in one of the most important life events a woman can have You think she was sitting there planning the baby coming along and was like I m going to invite everyone but u scarletdragonflyfl because fuck her It s a super self involved mindset to think she made the conscious decision to leave you out It s likely she didn t even think of you to begin with She was probably just considering people who lived closer to her and were still in her life rather than everyone from her past You guys grew apart you probably weren t on the top of her list to include in things I understand that it hurt your feelings but you re acting like she did it with malicious intent She had a baby It s got nothing to do with you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 21:12:48 2017|71|The person handling customer service likely has nothing to do with the error so laying into them just makes their day worse for something they have no control over It s hard working in customer service They re the punching bags for literally everything it s good to have some compassion Calling and making the error known of course Calling and laying into the person who is tying to help rude 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 19:19:37 2017|53|I just thought of this if the mortgage company knows the mortgage holder is a male I assume they have that somewhere maybe they use that terminology because of the female name Like they see the mortgage holder is a guy so they assume that guy is not Leigh but Leigh s husband 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 18:46:52 2017|76|I have not had this issue and I have a very obviously female name Sounds like some kind of internal error If your husband bought it when single and didn t add anyone to the deed he should contact them and let them know that they shouldn t be sending mail addressed to anyone but him I m surprised that you haven t had him do that yet considering how much it seems to bother you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 16:16:31 2017|112|So I guess my prerogative is that you don t really know him well enough to know if this is normal behavior for him that has nothing to do with you Full disclosure I m a person that falls asleep really easily and stays asleep through things like texts and phone calls though I might answer them I m not actually awake when I do If someone doesn t jostle me awake I ll sleep for hours I m not saying you have to date him but I am saying it might just be who he is and he isn t doing it consciously or subconsciously to show his lack of caring 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 16:08:47 2017|8|So you have been together for a month 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 16:01:27 2017|19|You didn t listen to the advice given in the original post so why are you asking for more 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 26 15:59:24 2017|14|Does he have a busy life What s the time period between these events 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 22:44:21 2017|7|So then just ignore and move on 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 22:42:48 2017|66|I don t think it necessary to support someone based on their gender Not into cat fights backstabbing pettiness and such but I m not going to automatically support everything a person does because she s a woman Sorry whatever happened to you but your rant does seem a bit targeted toward a specific person so it s probably better to take it up with them 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 22:32:09 2017|14|Why don t you just PM them or reply to their comment or something 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 21:08:30 2017|30|Sweet Jesus don t do that Your body is confused as hell right now so you re not going to get your period Hopefully you didn t cause any damage 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 16:24:45 2017|10|Yea you just need to be chivalrous regardless of gender 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 05:31:01 2017|35|I responded directly to everything you said If you have no valid response it s fine to be done with me but don t turn it around on me like I m the problem here 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 05:23:28 2017|74|No one here is offended by the word vagina The majority of commenters like me don t see why you re so stuck on her saying it Kids have different comfort levels Challenging her comfort level to the point of tears over something as arbitrary as what she calls a vagina is really sad She can say it when she feels okay saying it Until then let her say whatever she feels comfortable saying 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 05:07:18 2017|63|It doesn t make sense not to force your daughter to say something she doesn t want to say This is a surefire way of traumatizing her into never being comfortable saying it She s 8 years old Chill out Plus if you re into splitting hairs and using proper terms always which clearly you are it s a vulva not a vagina 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 04:56:40 2017|24|If it upsets her that much stop saying it She doesn t need to say the word vagina if it makes her so uncomfortable 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 03:08:24 2017|10|Hair grows a half an inch per month on average 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 02:10:38 2017|4|Eight months on average 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 01:21:07 2017|22|Those last two situations don t really seem like they were hitting on you The first one definitely wasn t cool though 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 01:02:59 2017|7|You were the one who asked Cupcake 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 00:43:23 2017|32|Like I said your end result will be you being forever alone Not my problem Not worth arguing Go on with your denial and have fun never having a relationship again deuces 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 00:36:32 2017|72| Specifics Read your post All of that There are plenty of wonderful reasonable men who say all sorts of things that aren t hateful toward women You re just not one of them Frankly though you arguing doesn t really matter because you re the one that will continue being alone So if that s your end goal you re doing a great job Just not sure why you posted about it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 00:30:32 2017|21|There s a lot a guy who doesn t women wouldnt say And that includes pretty much everything you ve written 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 25 00:25:17 2017|9|Amazingly women prefer men who don t hate women 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 20:19:33 2017|10|Oh and here I thought this was a real post 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 20:17:11 2017|28|What health products are you referring to specifically I understand the problems surrounding birth control but I can t think of anything else that is hard to get 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 19:36:51 2017|59|I wouldn t consider it an alternate as my old username doesn t still exist and as it isn t a new one from being banned anywhere I ve never been banned from any sub actually since I tend to just leave if I don t like the content I do change my username about every six months though 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 19:29:51 2017|20|She disagrees with your opinion so she calls you a troll and reports everything you post That s her MO 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 19:28:58 2017|104|No it isn t For one you used Joss Whedon s bad WW script as a point The movie would have been successful regardless because people would have gone for Joss Whedon as he is a successful and popular director Some as what will happen with batgirl which is why he was chosen For two the article is talking about supposedly good female directors The director of Wonder Woman was not good Regardless of storyline or any of my feelings on its marketing her directing really was not good Add to that the terrible editing and it was difficult to watch in many places 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 18:48:04 2017|58|Probably This is like the 6th or 7th that I ve counted Someone has to have a really bad addiction to Reddit to keep ban evading like that I don t want to be harsh though because obviously there s not much else going on in that kind of person s life so I try to be sympathetic 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 18:38:21 2017|79|I don t rely on critics to supply my personal opinion on movies and a decent amount of viewers do agree with me Of course they didn t develop that opinion until after paying for and seeing the movie so box office numbers aren t quite a reliable thing Successful good It just means it was marketed well They knew touting it as feminist empowering to women would appeal to a large group of people but unfortunately they lied 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 18:34:09 2017|23|Nah I ve had many discussions with many other women who also were extremely disappointed with it Not as rare as you think 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 17:14:38 2017|53|Some of these movies and shows are very good but many of the directors are not names anyone would recognize People tend to be chosen for more than their direction ability for movies by large studios like DC and Joss Whedon is more of a household name than any of the people listed 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 16:43:50 2017|7|So was the movie that was made 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 16:43:00 2017|17|Did you see Wonder Woman Whatever clowns wrote and directed that aren t suited to direct either 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 16:35:50 2017|4|7 months not years 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 03:43:35 2017|27|I don t remember that part of Suicide Squad If you re talking about one frame in a comic book find something more substantial to complain about 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 21:24:52 2017|12|Strong disagree But he wasn t mentioned in this comment thread anyhow 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 21:17:57 2017|10|And shirtless Thor was definitely not meant to be sexy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 21:16:03 2017|13|Lol thousands of women would disagree with majority of those being non sexy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 20:32:07 2017|18|Yes often people use an example when discussing their point rather than listing every single instance of something 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 19:15:14 2017|14|Yea muscular men in tight clothes or shirtless definitely not meant to be sexy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 16:45:22 2017|23|Yea because the men in superhero movies totally aren t designed to look sexy and attractive Just women are getting that treatment s
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 07:34:56 2017|35|If she wasn t having sex at 21 there really wouldn t have been a need to get a pap I m sure some docs would suggest it but a lot would find it unnecessary 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 01:14:40 2017|5|False equivalence On my Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 23 00:37:01 2017|16|Yea The only people on edge are the ones who have been engaging in shitty behavior 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 22 23:27:48 2017|3|Why would they 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:17:32 2017|7|Oh so like a sorority Sounds cool 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:10:21 2017|2| Join feminism 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:07:40 2017|17|So a bunch of people I don t know or care about Heavens Whatever will I do 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:05:25 2017|13|Value to who 14 year olds like yourself I m okay with that 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:02:58 2017|12|He posts this like every couple days He s just ban evading 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 21:01:54 2017|26|Why do you post this every few days Men look way different by their late 20s too You will that find out in about 15 years 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 15:03:22 2017|3|Start using protection 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 06:46:13 2017|48|That links to the pic but not the post on mobile at least Not sure what it s about but if someone posts a pic of themselves on a sub like that it kind of opens them up to dumb comments But that s kind of the point 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Nov 21 04:30:19 2017|50|Well you can work on losing weight and go to therapy Those two things should carry you through to your goal But be honest with yourself too 5 7 and 220lbs is obese Calling yourself not that fat is lying to yourself and that isn t the way to heal 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:45:07 2017|10|I just don t associate with any whiny MRAs methinks 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:40:58 2017|20|So it s not relevant to this sub Just like International Dog Day isn t relevant on the cat subreddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:37:49 2017|22|No I have not had any men in my life express that they have had gender specific problems that have gotten overlooked 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:34:35 2017|52|Why make it a pissing contest Everyone s got hardships You re free to talk about men s hardships on man based subreddits or basically any other subreddit that isn t for a specific group of people so go do that instead of pretending like you don t know you re trolling 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:32:31 2017|45| This day is important to me because I ve lost many male friends to suicide Sorry for your losses but it still isn t relevant on a woman s sub unless you re looking for our opinions of men in the context of our lives 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:31:07 2017|13|Awareness of what Men I am pretty sure we know that men exist 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:29:48 2017|25|But this is a woman s sub I don t go to a judaism sub and wish them a Merry Christmas It s just trolly 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 20 01:26:18 2017|37|Happy International Men s Day Though I don t think this post belongs here without any context of how it pertains to women Do you want us to talk about the men in our life or what 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 20:06:33 2017|36|You can say someone is awesome without painting others as less Stay at home moms are cool but they re no more or less heroic than those who don t have the luxury to stay home 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 17:17:05 2017|21|No one should be required to her anything this hypocritical walking sack of crap says She needs to be made irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 08:06:32 2017|23|You re arguing two completely separate points Stick to the one that I m actually talking about Actually it doesn t really matter 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:30:19 2017|24|I feel as though I don t give a shit what you think I ll form my solid opinion on it when it happens 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:27:53 2017|66|Do I really have to explain that to you Really Any dedicated person can care for feed sustain an infant If mom passes away and has someone else care for the little bean the baby will not die A zygote and a fetus are literally living off the woman s body and nutrients Like a parasite If the woman passes away the zygote fetus dies too 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:18:17 2017|23|I know it s the future but I m not going to form an opinion on something when it s not in practice 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:14:10 2017|25|I m sure there could b argument made in both directions but I don t really care much either way since it s a hypothetical 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:11:34 2017|62|It s beyond possession The zygote is literally being kept alive by the woman Men are incapable of sustaining that life So the entire life of it hinges completely on the woman not the man So no the choice is not equal But I mean even if you do want to use the word possession it s nine tenths of the law 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:03:21 2017|17|You asked why the father doesn t have an equal say in the abortion that s why 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:02:40 2017|11|No I haven t You just seem to lack reading comprehension 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 07:00:48 2017|97| In what sense is having an abortion taking responsibility They don t want to be pregnant and are taking the steps to deal with it That s taking responsibility Abortions aren t a light decision or a walk in the park for most women Given the hypothetical you think it s better to let a person bleed to death than forcefully take blood from the person who caused the bleeding in the first place It s better to honor everyone s bodily autonomy Someone doesn t lose their own just because they took someone else s away 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 06:54:50 2017|21|When men can carry a pregnancy and experience everything that comes along with it they can get equal day in it 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 06:52:23 2017|41|If someone choosing to spend all the money on IVF and an artificial womb and then no longer wants the fetus I d guess they could put it up for adoption in utero and not have to sustain it any longer 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 06:46:18 2017|16|Having an abortion is taking responsibility And no no one should be forced to give blood 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 06:28:43 2017|20|Her body is the only thing keeping the zygote alive so it s her choice whether not to do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 05:10:46 2017|16|Wowza Both men and women can cheat By God you ve blown the case wide open 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 02:57:34 2017|20|She is still a horrible person No one should be giving her a platform to speak in the first place 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 01:13:39 2017|17|I dunno then My crowns were 1300 each for me so 1000 sounds like a good deal 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 19 01:08:15 2017|7|Maybe you didn t hit your deductible 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:31:04 2017|100| I ll just ignore and reportShe said as she replied to the comment I m definitely not a troll Someone disagreeing with you doesn t make them a troll You re acting like somehow saying Dunham is a horrible person is only valid when it comes from someone who you agree with on all other cases She s a hypocrite and she s trash I don t care if a man says it or a woman says it It s true and it doesn t deserve to be silenced just because some redditors hurt your feelings on some other issue 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:27:30 2017|79|And there s a sizable amount of people who aren t You re a redditor I m a redditor Ain t nothing hypocritical for me to call her a trash person so stop grouping everyone under the same blanket just because you don t like some of the commenters on this sub A broken clock is right twice a day I m not going to talk shit about that broken clock if it s currently displaying the correct time 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:24:26 2017|48|Funny how you deleted your comment defending Lena Dunham but now accuse everyone here of defending harassers and rapists on the daily Fairly certain at least half the commenters are women on this thread But let s just ignore those because they don t fit into your narrative 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:21:26 2017|81|I mean go ahead If someone in this thread is a known rapist or if they molested their kid sister please do point them out Not sure what the broad term of redditors millions of people with differing experiences and personalities has to do with whether or not it s okay to discuss the singular trash person that is Lea Dunham though But it just sounds like your grasping for straws now Sorry it hurts your feelings that she s garbage 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:12:16 2017|44|I mean they re commenting on her hypocrisy and how much a horrible person she is which is completely relevant when it s an article about her being a horrible hypocrite again Some are less eloquent than others but not everyone is a wordsmith 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 15:08:01 2017|16|The only trash heap is her Ain t nothing wrong with calling out a hypocritical celebrity 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:41:22 2017|13|I m sure but his opinion is equally as irrelevant as a troll 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:35:15 2017|10| principal sBut no I don t work in a school 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:25:46 2017|5|No I work with kiddos 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:25:24 2017|7|So then what s the issue here 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:06:36 2017|18|Only person in this entire thread that seems upset is you Do you need a safe space snowflake 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:04:56 2017|8|So does that make you a feminist then 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:03:44 2017|4|Why I m bored 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:03:30 2017|18|I know it s a troll I m waiting for my work day to finish so why not 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 18 00:00:23 2017|19|I don t see a reason why I should do that I m not the one who is upset 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 17 23:58:46 2017|4|Maybe get over it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 17 21:18:50 2017|61|Evry single person has done something incredibly shitty at some point in their lives That doesn t make them trash It makes them human How they deal with the fact that they ve done something shitty how they atone for it and whether or not they learn from it plays a huge factor in whether or not a person is trash 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 17 04:37:32 2017|25|Yes Because the only acceptable way to terminate a pregnancy is if a woman chooses for herself The killer has removed her ability to choose 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 13:37:41 2017|58|Sorry but regardless of how much she gets for a legal defense fund it is highly illegal to get a medical procedure performed on a child when you are not their guardian no matter what the procedure is Having a good lawyer doesn t change that fact Encouraging and arguing for someone to do this is extremely stupid 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 13:30:56 2017|32|Yea Tdap booster should happen every 10 years plus any time you ll be in regular close contact with a newborn The P in tdap is pertussis which is the whooping cough 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 13:25:09 2017|31|I m not agreeing or disagreeing with that I m simply saying what the commenter suggests is highly illegal and it s a terrible idea to tell OP to do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 03:21:31 2017|9|HIPAA And it s not a violation of that 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 01:55:54 2017|71|You re not going to convince her with being rude confrontational calling her a dumbass or any of the other suggestions here No one responds positively to their viewpoint being met with aggression Her viewpoint is best met with empathy and understanding of her side followed by gently discussing facts with her Better yet find a pediatrician that she really likes who will nudge her in the right direction towards vaccines 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 01:51:26 2017|7|Cool yea OP get ready for jail 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov 16 01:48:22 2017|61|The normal vaccine schedule has kids finished with most of their vaccines earlier than they can remember what happened to them Spreading them out just makes the kid associate The doctor with pain and negativity because they re getting shots every single time they re seen There s very little health risk in a normal child with getting vaccines on schedule 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 15 16:53:12 2017|32|Which is probably why he is asking people instead of saying Whatever she s overly sensitive Doesn t matter what she says He is literally doing what she asked him to do

TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 20:26:48 2017|37|You re putting the cart before the horse Wait for your diagnosis and then go from there Diagnosing yourself with something that you don t even have the symptoms for is just creating unnecessary stress for yourself 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 20:12:46 2017|29|Urinary frequency and pelvic pain are signs of a UTI But you know what Don t get medical advice on the internet Go to a doctor with your concerns 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 20:07:36 2017|16|It sounds like a UTI Go to the doc for the right antibiotic to treat it 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 16:06:41 2017|4|Yes you sound condescending 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 15:51:01 2017|22|You sound a little condescending about cultural norms in China Why are you living there if you think so lowly of them 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 02:36:14 2017|76|Sorry about your mom That s sad But it doesn t give you a right to bear judgement on others relationships with their mothers Parenting and grand parenting are two different ball games My mother dropped the ball a bunch as a mom and I have a lot of unresolved issues with her but she would be a fine grandparent so there s no reason why I d prevent my child from spending time with her 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 00:51:08 2017|17|Why should we play light and friendly with someone who comes boasting of their pretension and intelligence 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 00:11:43 2017|30|Reminds me of the whole you re not wrong or I don t disagree thing It really is so hard for people to say you re right or I agree 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 00:06:54 2017|22|Then maybe you should hold off on announcing that you re so smart so you lack a very important form of intelligence 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov 13 00:00:52 2017|10|Saying you feel stupid around someone isn t a compliment 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 16:58:14 2017|10|Yea There are hundreds of studies on nature vs nurture 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 16:21:07 2017|25|No it s not and I m not going to continue this conversation when you re clearly trying to skew my words Get a life 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 16:01:22 2017|19|I have not in any way excused his actions or made any claims that what he did was okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 08:45:33 2017|47|You only came here to try and validate his actions You re not interested in learning anything In other words you re just trolling He even agrees that what he did was wrong He s not looking for some socially inept rando to vindicate him on Reddit 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 08:02:09 2017|19|Explaining consent to people who are purposefully obtuse is a waste of time You damn well know the difference 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 07:50:34 2017|10|Just speaking into the ether but if the shoe fits 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov 12 07:46:04 2017|39|I was surprised at first to see how many people are incapable of grasping the concept of actual consent vs being pressured into something but then I remembered that Reddit banned Incels so they ve migrated to other areas 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 23:44:26 2017|19| any other accusers yetAt any rate not sure what that has to do with MLK being a good guy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 18:52:35 2017|9|Yea I would definitely call MLK as swell guy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 18:49:50 2017|18|Somehow I don t think infidelity belongs on the same list as child rape physical abuse and murder 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 17:35:48 2017|139| My point is that I don t care that he apologized He did a bad thing that he knew was bad And my point is why I don t see a reason to treat someone who actually did take accountability for their actions in the same way as the large swath of people who haven t When you harass women like that you don t just get a free pass after saying sorry What free pass is he getting You can still be disapproving and disgusted of what someone did while being open to their promises of growing as a person and never doing stuff like that again I have 0 sympathy for him I don t have sympathy for him either but I do think people deserve to be given a chance to make good on their word 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 17:23:35 2017|105|I don t see people beyond anti woman dummies who don t even deserve the time of day excusing his actions but at some point when a person apologizes takes accountability for their actions and is prepared to deal with the consequences we can stop crucifying them What he did was gross and creepy 100 But he admitted to it yes it should have been sooner and if he is genuine in his dedication to take steps to stop talking and listen I think he deserves a chance to atone for his transgression So I m tentatively on the side of not completely boycotting him 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 16:24:03 2017|13|He masturbated to completion in front of the two women who were together 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 01:55:15 2017|61|As I said it will be hard to prove he did anything illegal Regardless of the admission that he did do it it s he said she said about what led up to it and there s been no talk of anyone telling him to stop Abuse of power absolutely but prosecutable Meh Probably just a waste of time and money 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 01:45:13 2017|72|Hey I m not defending what he did at all Totally creepy Legality wise I don t think it would be easy to prove that he did anything illegal though That s all I m saying I respect that he took accountability apologized and made a vow to stop talking and listen instead It doesn t undo what he did but it s a good start for the women to begin healing 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 01:17:46 2017|40|It actually seems from what everyone says including the women involved he did get consent It s just that the duo of women thought he was kidding and at least one other just didn t think she could say no 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 10 01:09:31 2017|33| Is it such a crime to want someone to reproduce A crime No But it s really not anyone s business but the person who is choosing whether or not to do it 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 10 00:42:42 2017|146|I do think women get more pressure as far as children go but to claim that nobody does it to men isn t accurate either Men also get a lot of attempted dissuasion about vasectomies You just don t experience it because you aren t a man Anecdotally I ve run into a lot more acceptance of not having children than pushback Of course there will always be nosy people but I don t see why I should let them bother me Equally as annoying to me are people that go on and on about how oppressed they are for being childfree And people who are rude and condescending towards those who choose to be parents Everyone should just live their dang lives the way they want without someone else being an ass to them for choosing to do it differently than what they d choose 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  9 22:46:59 2017|17|Men s definition of man hating is a lot different than women s definition of woman hating 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  9 03:16:12 2017|19|It s too bad it took DT getting elected to get people to get off their asses and vote 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 22:18:50 2017|8|K changed my comment just for you 3
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 22:13:36 2017|45|No this was more than a year and at least one phone ago and I didn t really give a crap about it by the next day other than that I thought the fact that I was the one that got suspended was pretty lame 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 22:07:21 2017|19|No I don t want to talk about this and no I am not misinformed Have a good day 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 22:03:56 2017|45| I don t support people that act like that nor will I give them a voice to spew that kind of vitriol And yet you identify as an MRA I m fine lumping those people together because they re two sides of the same coin 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 20:42:34 2017|38|I mean they re my opinions If I thought my opinions were wrong I would change them But I don t So I won t So again I don t care what he or you has to say 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 20:05:41 2017|22|Again I don t care about your opinion on feminism I don t have to defend it to you You are irrelevant 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 20:04:38 2017|11|Okay I don t care Didn t I already say that 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 20:02:56 2017|35|No they don t They want to invalidate women s experiences and tell them how much worse men have it I m fine with equality between the sexes That s why I subscribe to MensLib 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 19:57:31 2017|10|Then why was it a response to my parent comment 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 19:56:44 2017|28|I don t personally care if you take me seriously or not Most MRAs are just incels that occasionally find a women who is willing to fuck them 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 19:55:33 2017|1|Yup 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 19:12:44 2017|15|I m sorry I m not sure how that s related to what I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  8 18:04:52 2017|197|I mean I get that the admins are just trying to improve their public image Especially considering Reddit spawned Elliott Rodger Dylan Rooffe and others But it s not like those people are going to disappear They re just going to congregate in other subs that don t explicitly promote violence against women like MensRights and MGTOW and continue with their toxicity Any time I ve reported PMs from men who have said things like I d like to put you through a meat grinder feet first so I can see you suffer and die nothing has come of it Those accounts still exist and still post their horrible stuff And the one time a few years ago I posted a screen shot of a dude s PMs where he threatened to rape me because I identified as a feminist in reply to his comments I got my account suspended for spam They like to have their public facing stuff seem like they re actually against this stuff but in reality they give zero fucks and then try to act surprised when they spawn another misogynist piece of shit who murders women for not giving him sex 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov  6 03:54:33 2017|91|Her dresses aren t different from any other dresses her fellow anchors wear She fills them out differently because she s curvier You seem to have an unconscious bias against her which is unfortunate It seems a bit tinged with racism but that s for you to reflect on which I doubt you will do But in the end she s the one who is looking awesome and gets to do what she loves while you re complaining about her on Reddit so frankly I don t need to defend her 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov  6 03:43:33 2017|17|A news anchor wearing a fitted dress is not akin to wearing a bikini at a library 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov  6 03:36:23 2017|49|So then what s the problem here She can wear what she wants to work as long as it isn t breaking dress code You specifically bring up dress code It s not breaking dress code so I am not sure what you re fussing about to be honest 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Nov  6 03:31:08 2017|22|Clearly if she is allowed to wear what she wears it isn t breaking the dress code at her place of work 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 22:28:17 2017|17|It doesn t have to be thanksgiving to cook a turkey Freeze the leftovers Eat for weeks 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 19:06:42 2017|1|Yes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 17:44:09 2017|51|She gets banned or suspended and then creates new usernames to ban evade but it s glaringly obvious who she is It s like yea you re really pulling a fast one by making a new username immediately and continuing to post I think it borders on addiction at this point 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 16:39:26 2017|10|You somehow made this woman s situation entirely about you 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 06:17:59 2017|29|Because society puts a large emphasis on the importance of being beautiful As far as the body of your text goes I have no idea what it even says 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Nov  5 06:15:48 2017|9|How on earth do people this fragile even exist 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 18:10:11 2017|21|Terribly acted Why does this exist How would people in a close knit group of friends not know she was single 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 16:04:45 2017|81|If you want to reply to things you need to press reply and type it in the box You are making new parent comments I can almost guarantee he would take the piss out of a boy the same way I m all for pointing out sexism and calling out rape culture but this ain t it Honestly the people harping about trivial stuff like this and using mental gymnastics to be offended tends to remove the gravity from actual complaints 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 15:02:56 2017|35|Why does the kid being black make it worse At any rate that seemed all in good fun Like when you have a little cousin and they say the opposite sex has cooties Just teasing 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 06:22:28 2017|16|Whereas I don t find either to be a big deal Diff rent Strokes theme song 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 06:17:09 2017|64|Honestly as far as something like this goes I have experienced women doing this much more often The line for the ladies room is too long so they just go to the men s room and act like it s no big deal But if a man using the ladies room is a big deal then so is the opposite Invasion of privacy etc 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:48:45 2017|12|For someone going their own way they sure are focused on women 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  1 04:34:08 2017|19| Asians are the most racist peoples with a hierarchy that puts Japanese in first place Only to the Japanese 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Oct 30 20:58:34 2017|25|That would be ideal but unfortunately unrealistic But people can protect themselves while we work towards a better world where they don t need protection 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Oct 30 14:57:33 2017|8|Are you getting it in your inner thigh 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Oct 30 06:46:05 2017|82|I don t think servers need any more hostility over trivial things than they already get My boyfriend and I had a conversation earlier about how we can tell if someone has been in the service industry or not I m fairly certain you would be in the not column Show a little empathy They ve got a lot to deal with and generally just give the check to whoever asked for it or place it in the middle of the table 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Oct 30 06:33:58 2017|8|Likely more exposure to different strains of HPV 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Oct 29 15:28:30 2017|63|In this case they re just trying to emulate strong girl heros not necessarily the culture they happen to be from Kids LOVE Doc McStuffins and a lot of little girls want to be her for Halloween As long as they re not thrown into blackface I don t see the harm They re admiring and emulating her not her race or culture 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Oct 29 03:28:14 2017|24|I d like to think most people who are looking to settle down with a person are considering more than just their sexual prowess 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Oct 28 06:55:04 2017|66|The health at any size movement is predominantly female yes I wish it could be happiness at any size though Be happy with yourself regardless of the things you want need to improve Work to improve them but don t hate yourself during your journey You re still worthy of love and respect and self love as a human being no matter what you look like 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Oct 28 06:44:53 2017|6|Saturday night Where do you live 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Oct 28 05:55:19 2017|10|OP hasn t commented on this post at all though
