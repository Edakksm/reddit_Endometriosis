relationships|Mon Jul 30 11:11:21 2018|136|I just wanted to tell you that I relate so hard to this But your boyfriend sounds like jerk I have ADHD and always struggled with relationships until I met my husband I drive him nuts sometimes and he definitely struggles to keep up with how quickly my brain works but he also loves and supports me knows I wouldn t be the same without the ADHD You sound a lot like me several years ago before I learned to accept myself you re never going to be organized or punctual or normal and that s a okay You ll find yourself But you have to be okay with you before you ll really be happy with someone else I hope you find a loving partner who supports and loves you just the way you are
