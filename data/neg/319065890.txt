TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 16:13:45 2018|173|Why does dependency or needing others equate to deficiency to you Humans are social creatures It s okay to want or feel like you need others Regarding companionship I want and enjoy having someone to share my life with Having someone who can experience life with me and can tell my story after I m gone It s nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of and just talk and laugh with Sure I can talk to myself or live in my own thoughts but not engaging with others provides basically no stimulation and no room for growth Regarding intimacy humans are also generally sexual beings Much like companionship regardless of how content or complete I feel within myself there are things that are nice to experience with others Sex being one of those things At the very least a perk of being in a live in relationship for me is that there ll be someone there to cover me up and call the police if I suddenly fall dead while indecent 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 15:15:36 2018|1|No
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 14:15:32 2018|6|Companionship Intimacy Support Stuff like that 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 01:27:11 2018|31|Oh I haven t experienced any side effects really My period kind of disappeared Nothing adverse or worrisome though Yeah I just called at said I wanted to get an IUD 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 00:33:12 2018|263|So I have an incredibly low pain tolerance I just can t do pain And with that I can t do a lot of standard medical procedures elective vaccinations blood draws those random finger prick things etc just can t Needless so say I was terrified to get the IUD but I knew I needed it Honestly it wasn t all that bad They prescribed a 500mg ibuprofen to take before the procedure as well as some pill that helps your cervix relax I think I knew I was going to need more than ibuprofen so I self medicated a little possibly ill advised but worked for me I took 2 or 3 100mg acetaminophen and one lortab that I had left over from my wisdom teeth surgery Now despite all that I still felt some pain It was more like it was extremely uncomfortable rather than a prolonged excruciating sharp pain It was over very quickly The pain in the preceding day was like a long period cramp That lasted til he next day and I was fine If you re someone who has a similar pain tolerance or pain aversion or just extreme anxiety relate to this discuss that with your provider They may be willing to provide an additional pain pill or anxiety medication that will help you get through it From what I ve heard the period cramp sensation I experienced is pretty normal If you experience more pain or discomfort than that call your provider and see what they can do for you or if something is wrong 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 20:06:17 2018|16|Lol what did I say that was combative or inflammatory enough to merit the passive aggression 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 18:43:43 2018|115|Lol now I m dense Just kind of a friendly reminder just because you re anonymous on the internet doesn t mean that you need to be rude I stated my opinion You stated yours I gave my reason for why your argument did not make sense to me I m not being combative or inflammatory I m not personally attacking All that I ve stated is that I do not understand the push back to covering up I have not said all women must cover up or they re disgusting Or that women should saunter off in shame to feed their children The key to civil discussion is actually being civil Be well stranger 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 18:30:56 2018|38|I m not buying the it s not comfortable argument People carry babies in slings that cover up their faces for crying out loud But when it s time to feed now jimmy jr is uncomfortable Okie dokie 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 23 17:14:25 2018|107|I feel like my opinion may be unpopular But I m all for public breastfeeding Baby s gotta eat right I just don t understand the push back to covering up while doing so I am a woman I don t mind looking at boobs That doesn t mean I want to in a public space It s kind of like pooping to me everyone has a butt Everyone poops But I d have an issue with walking into a public restroom and seeing someone dropping one with the stall door wide open For the record I am not someone who thinks pooping or breastfeeding is gross 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Jul 12 19:47:31 2018|30|I simply don t care how others feel about my leg or armpit or pubic or arm hair Anyone who stares or snickers has issues that are not your problem 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 10 23:44:15 2018|11|Not as easy as you re making it sound But ok 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 02:42:29 2018|376|Probably not Your argument is another fallacy First If you had sex on a different day instead of the one you did when your daughter was conceived and ended up with a different daughter or a son that you also thought was the sweetest most amazing person in the world would you feel like your life was missing something In this scenario in which someone goes back in time and has my favorite person aborted how could that actually affect me You can t really feel the loss of something that you never knew existed Second Do you love your daughter Are you able to provide for your daughter Does your daughter love you Is she at the very least content with the life that you re able to provide for her Are you happy being a parent I m going to make my own assumption and assume that your answers to those are all yeses Which is really great for you and your daughter Now imagine what it would be like for a little girl whose parents couldn t provide for her did not have her basic needs met did not have parents that loved her or were happy being a parents And imagine that her parents knew this going in If they knew when the strip turned whatever color it turns that they themselves haven t eaten in a week or would be incapable of loving this child how responsible is it for them to carry that pregnancy to term Again not even beginning to touch how traumatic pregnancy and childbirth can be for a woman Now not being my first sparring match with someone who is anti choice experience and predictability tells me that you ll argue that adoption is always an option Great point How many kids surrendered at birth end up in foster care for a decade or more If we re talking white male babies not TOO many But what about a little black girl or boy What about a little kid who ends up having costly medical or developmental issues Is an unstable life in foster care in which often basic emotional needs are not met and in which children are often subject to violence and sexual abuse preferable 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 02:12:46 2018|30|Honestly curious why does it matter to you so much if blankety something year old what s her name from Whynot North Carolina chooses to carry a pregnancy to term 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 02:06:25 2018|5|Nope Not what I said 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 02:03:14 2018|12| but I am capable of making those decisions Dude Are you okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 01:59:39 2018|113|You re assuming that the person who chooses to terminate a pregnancy thinks that the embryo doesn t matter at all That s a false assumption Not to mention it seems like in your mindset the only way to prove that would be to give up her body for damn near 10 months and go through pregnancy and birth both extremely traumatic to give it life Whether or not I think I matter enough to exist has nothing to do with this However whether or not I matter enough to make my own medical reproductive and financial decisions does An embryo is incapable of making those decisions It does not get a say 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 01:47:04 2018|50|How is it messed up Your stance is that something that cannot survive outside of another life should have more of a say and matters more than the life that has to sustain it so that it can even be able to survive on its own in the first place 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul  3 00:14:36 2018|40|Not at all Your hypothetical is talking about taking away something that is already mine An embryo s life doesn t really belong to it Otherwise it could be expelled from the body at any point during gestation and survive 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul  2 23:35:24 2018|62|I mean if someone has a right to go back and talk to my mom about aborting me I don t see why I wouldn t be allowed to go back and make my case That said I most likely would not Not really sure this hypothetical scenario of impossible things can really be used as an argument for or against abortion 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jun 19 04:36:44 2018|34|I m sorry I ve had liletta for 2 years and I havent experienced any of the things you have described I hope you feel better soon If not hopefully your doctor can help

TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 30 23:50:00 2018|20|r nonmonogamy might be a better place But for starters everyone in this situation needs to learn and define boundaries

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 22:41:25 2018|20|No one should touch you without your permission or in a state in which you are incapable of providing consent 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 22:48:08 2018|44|Every couple defines this differently What works for some doesn t always work for others You have to figure out how much time you need with him vs how much time he needs vs how much time you can actually devote given life constraints 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Apr 23 04:03:02 2018|9|not necessarily depends on the rules of the relationship
