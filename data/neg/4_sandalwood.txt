TwoXChromosomes|Tue Jul 31 12:40:49 2018|5|That is my type exclusively 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 29 16:47:19 2018|193|I m a little confused These are things that are in your house that your parents have given you your parents aren t living with you and your parents are no longer expecting them back If that is the case they are no longer your parents but are yours The next time she makes a comment like that just say Mom and Dad gave me this one but I am sure you can find something in a similar style at antique shops flea market whatever If it continues past that I would contact your brother and say that this behavior makes you uncomfortable and you would like it to stop However it may be a good idea for you to subtly clue your parents in to this If she has been accidentally taking your stuff she has probably been taking theirs as well You can play this off as hey as a family why don t we all take inventory and get our wills done so everyone is protected you could make up a story about a coworker friend who had issues and you don t want this to happen to your family 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 15:38:10 2018|21|Cautious about money yes but your time Or do I misunderstand and you actually donate all your free time and energy 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 15:28:07 2018|37|But it is selfish to consider oneself before potential victims not actual victims but the potential for there to be other victims But not selfish to consider oneself because you don t know what the future holds 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 15:20:26 2018|17| I d simply not call these acts selfish in the first placeWhy are these actions not selfish 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 15:09:33 2018|24|Did I say that You are the one who speaks in absolutes selfish is inherently bad So then is selfish inherently bad or not 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 14:38:59 2018|70|Every penny you spend on yourself for anything other than your basic needs is selfish that money could potentially be used for other causes like ensuring people don t starve or have clean drinking water Every time you choose to stay in or have fun is selfish you could be donating time and energy to charitable organizations So then would you say you are selfish and that this is bad 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr  5 14:06:55 2018|17| I m having a hard time understanding this as not selfish Why is being selfish automatically bad 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 10 14:56:53 2017|152|I honestly feel weird that because it is another woman they don t need to have another person there I would feel more comfortable having my male gyno examine me alone than have a female tech without a chaperone I ve known my gyno for many years and feel very comfortable and safe with him I don t know that tech from Adam or I suppose Eve in this case Just because they are a woman doesn t mean they couldn t abuse me Not that I am really worried that any medical professional is going to do anything wrong more that I don t know this person and they are touching a very private part of me and that they have no oversight while they are doing so is super weird It s not enough for me to ask for one but if they offered I d be okay with it 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed May 10 03:22:17 2017|83|I am not a huggy person but I love to give hugs to people who need want them I m not the type to try to hug or touch someone unless they ask nor do I want to be touched or hugged unless I ask But if a friend needs a hug I will give the best hugs I can I wonder if any of the non huggers you know are like me and would love to give a hug if you asked 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May  9 14:14:35 2017|71|Could that extra fabric be used to make a wrap that offers a little more coverage Since I have no idea what it looks like I am limited on suggestions but there may be other ways to get the coverage you want Obvs I don t agree with what happened but since other people have covered that pretty well I want to make sure you feel comfortable in your fancy dress 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May  9 14:11:21 2017|9|What makes you think the woman would be fired 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May  9 14:10:25 2017|30|Heck they could ve turned it into an opportunity to sell more stuff a nice wrap or shrug that would cover a little more and look good with the dress 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May  9 14:08:19 2017|13|WTF why would you think one complaint is going to ruin her career 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May  9 14:05:45 2017|259| but if you go back with that complaint she WILL lose her jobIn all of my life in all of the retail I have ever worked I have never seen just one complaint of this caliber being enough to fire someone If you go in and politely say Hey I wasn t a fan of this if the dress wasn t able to be altered okay but there was no reason to make out like I was a prude because I wanted to be covered more Maybe talk to her about how to approach a situation like this in the future she won t get fired I don t understand why people assume that every complaint means someone will get fired Most managers won t bother with that they d rather gently correct the person than fire them for a first offense Every time I ve ever made a complaint in my personal life I ve made it clear I don t want to have this person fired and that I m letting the manager know so they can correct the behavior rather than firing the person And then I will go to the place later and the person will be there Sheesh if every complaint got a person fired there would be no one working retail Everyone gets a crazy customer once in a while that just wants to complain managers know when it is bullshit and when it really is something that needs to be addressed or if it so bad their employment needs to be terminated 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 28 20:30:12 2017|243|I had an ablation in part because I was full of polyps I looooooooooooove it A weekend of discomfort and I haven t had a period in 2 5 years I don t know if I was just lucky my doc is really awesome or both but I haven t had any bleeding or pain afterwards Mine was a miracle from heaven It may be the most expensive option but if it is a good choice for you look at it as cost time How much would you spend on pills IUD in money and time until menopause and how does that tally with the cost of the ablation How do you usually do with surgery does it work well do you have a history of complications post surgery Also ask the doctor what their opinion is or what they would do in your position they ve seen this issue the most and may have an idea of what kind of failure success rate they ve had I had the radio wave type of ablation not the hot water type so how the ablation is done also matters I see others mentioning hysterectomy I feel like that is a much more drastic option with a greater risk of complications I m not a big fan of hysterectomies my mother had to have one and end up with adhesions and pain but that may be my bias and it may be a good solution
