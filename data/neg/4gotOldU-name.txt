TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 18:04:29 2017|64|This reminds me of the 60 s book Black Like Me non fiction where a white guy dyed his skin dark to experience what it s like to be a back person Men should somehow be able to put themselves in the shoes of women figuratively no need to torture here to get this understanding Some empathy is best learned rather than just told 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 17:50:10 2017|124|Two things 1 if a couple worker has headphones on I always tap their desk vs them Don t like startling people as I don t like it 2 I remember at crowded bars trying to get by through a pack of people you HAVE to touch people to be able to get their attention and get them to let you by I m a guy The ONLY way I would ever touch a female in this situation is with a rigid flat hand on the shoulder keeping both my hands up high and visible as I passed Never once caused me an issue with females or their attached but out of reach boyfriends It s all in the intent body language and circumstances 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Sep 30 19:59:57 2017|6|Well THAT was a hostile reply 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Aug 20 15:31:31 2017|8|That s some Bill Cosby sized crime history
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Aug  6 14:11:42 2017|113|Ok a guy s input here doesn t matter but I wanted to be transparent What you wrote is seriously messed up Not what you did you 100 did the right thing but rather what external to the issue people said or how they acted towards you Even the person who got what she deserved My opinion is simple it takes great strength and courage to do what you did and stick to your decision even in the face of those trying to convince you that YOU were somehow wrong or at fault here Edit and your title is completely wrong BTW You ARE the bigger person already for sticking to your decision 
relationships|Sun Jul 29 13:31:42 2018|141|Well that s completely one sided and selfish So you wouldn t bring up anything more than the minimum information to test the waters So let s play this out 1 He says ok Is your response then good because there s this guy who I did screw and want to continue You don t have to answer as it is obvious 2 He says ok because he wants to get with your younger hotter sister You fine with that 3 He says no You continue to lie and be unfaithful 4 He drops you on the spot for suggesting it What then 5 He says Why Don t I provide enough for you Now what s your response to that that will be truthful You won t be because now you re stuck so what s your next play here 
relationships|Sat Jul 28 16:35:33 2018|65|I m missing the point here I guess It sounds like you are lecturing rather than offering any advice and you honestly don t have nearly enough details to give lectures on this situation You don t even know if she was equally abusive or less or even more There s always more than one side to things like this I know from direct experience 
relationships|Sat Jul 28 16:28:05 2018|147|One thing if I may Though I do agree that informing about your past history is a good thing as it s better in every way than it coming as a surprise and at an inopportune time that doesn t mean that you need to go into microscopic details Just say enough to inform that there were some ugly times in your past and that you were an equal part in the ugliness Maybe some broad stroke examples but then just leave it there From there it s up to the other person to want to know more and if she does don t lie But if the other person is satisfied and doesn t want to ask you more then you re done and if the Ex does try to warn her she is armed with some knowledge beforehand and may even shut down the Ex 
relationships|Sat Jul 28 16:13:08 2018|59|That s because it s super easy to just see posts as reality TV and people are preferring to comment in ways that are provocative and stirring things up than to actually dig into their own bank of morals and ethics and comment what they really would if the person in question was a friend or a family member
