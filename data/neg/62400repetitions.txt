TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 18:09:52 2017|225| You look unhappy I d find you more attractive if you could just ignore everything going on in your life to go ahead and smile at me I find you far more aesthetically pleasing that way Also that s 3 45 for the energy drinks You really look like you need them too haha Dear cashiers everywhere please stop telling me to smile If I look pretty upset it s probably because I am If I look tired it s cause I am No need to be a dick about it There was a point in time where I looked very upset tired and stressed and gas station attendants told me to smile all the damn time Nah bro I m a full time student working three jobs and my dad is in the hospital possibly dying and I have to figure what I m going to do to support my younger siblings if he passes I m practically on the brink of tears from stress and sleep deprivation I m not gonna smile so you enjoy looking at me more Now I always just say my dog died if a random person tells me to smile I m allowed to be upset and it seems to get the point across that people have other shit going on besides pretending to look happy for you

TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec  6 14:54:45 2017|225|Taylor Swift was literally sued by a man that she reported for grabbing under her dress years ago She didn t settle to keep it under wraps Instead she countersued for 1 so a judge would have to decide if he had assaulted her or not in a civil court of law Maybe you weren t paying attention or just didn t care when it happened but people were FUCKING AWFUL to her They called her a liar slut man hater gold digger etc etc The picture of her assault was released to the public and underwent SO much criticism But she took it all the way to court and said that she refused to be shamed for this man s actions And she won both cases Then she made large donations to organizations that support victims of sexual assault Jesus Christ that s STILL not good enough She reported it to his superiors since he was working at the time She didn t press charges with the police for the same reasons hundreds of victims don t But when he tried to take advantage of her again and she decided it was worth all the media scrutiny and name calling that still doesn t count Are we really at the point of criticizing victims that DID speak out for not doing enough Fucking really 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov 22 17:07:02 2017|19|Are you saying pulling out and condoms together or that you think it s better to just pull out 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov  4 19:50:05 2017|26|Let them make their own choices Seriously why can t we support women that are speaking up for other women without tearing them down for something 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct 24 17:00:49 2017|34|I recently saw a post from an anti vaxxer trying to spread the term vaccine rape or something similar Words lose meaning if the severity isn t maintained by applying it to other situations 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct 24 15:14:36 2017|24|In the US yes some states are two party consent Basically meaning both parties in a private conversation have to consent to being recorded 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct 17 22:54:33 2017|158|Absolutely nothing beneficial at all Men will get more and more defensive because who the fuck wouldn t if they were arbitrarily lumped in with rapists and even more victim blaming will occur as people try to fight back against the men are the problem ideology I know men that were raped by women when they were passed out and didn t say anything officially because their friends laughed at it Too many women I know have been sexually harassed or assaulted and been told it was their fault or told to take it as a compliment All we can do especially women is try to shut that ideology down when it comes up Far too often I see men mocked for the not all men defense when it shouldn t even have to said at all We can bring awareness without alienating anyone by avoiding gendered language and allowing all victims like OP to participate in campaigns 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct 17 20:22:26 2017|136|It really pisses me off to be honest It literally does not help anyone I understand that assault at the hands of a male may make someone wary of men but that doesn t negate all experiences of female aggressors with male or female victims or male on male sexual assault People that spew this rhetoric are hurting the movement It creates a false dichotomy of men v women and shifts the focus away from victims and perpetrators It s so fucking easy to disprove that all men are predators or only women are victims that it weakens all the conversations when it s brought up Sorry it just makes me really angry that people can pretend to be supporting victims when they re actively hurting their chances of being believed protected and supported in society 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct 17 19:00:43 2017|176|Women can also be predators It ISN T and SHOULDN T be a commentary on men that sexual assault exists Using gendered language on this issue only hurts victims Men will feel as though they are personally under attack even though they ve never and would never assault someone Why force half the population into an other category when they want to be our allies How can they use their voices to support us when they have to constantly fight back against false perceptions that every male is a predator We re literally on a post of a victim feeling like they can t share their experience for raising sexual assault awareness because they were victimized by a woman How fucked up is that It defeats the whole purpose of getting victims to speak up if some feel like that their aren t supported If you really care about sexual assault awareness then you would stop alienating victims and allies The physical and emotional stakes are too high for us to create divisions within the movement 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Oct 12 01:09:11 2017|29|And in my case the woman was bleeding heavily but was still arrested because the cops rightfully took the man s side You see how including anecdotal data works 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Oct 11 05:46:54 2017|279|I ve seen men take a woman s side when she clearly explained how she was the one at fault in a domestic violence situation As in this woman attacked her boyfriend physically and destroyed many of his possessions and when he tried to prevent her from hurting him more while he was on the phone with police she fell on the parking lot and got road rash She had gotten mad because he wanted to leave since he had an early class the next day The men verbally attacked the boyfriend and said how she had done nothing wrong the police should have arrested him police are the worst if they ever see him again they ll attack him etc Men don t always protect men There s a reason why white knighting is a phrase I will say that same group of guys regularly defended a man who was accused of sexual harassment I wasn t part of the group of women that reported him but I could have been they didn t tell me they were reporting him together When I told the men what I had personally experienced and the complaints I d heard from others they loved to say well I still like him well he s a cool guy he never did something like that to me so we re still cool this one annoyed me the most I don t know if it s the difference between being able to visibly see the marks left after an encounter bruises scratches or even seeing emotional marks when someone is crying about it vs just hearing about it that affects whose side people take

TwoXChromosomes|Tue Aug 15 20:38:46 2017|41|And he thought the picture supported his side I really don t understand his his legal team s thought process there How does this show you didn t grab someone s ass He says he was touching her ribs there Huh 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Aug 15 20:34:14 2017|100|Him filing the suit was a stunt to out himself as someone that sexually assaults people then demands money from them so that she could eventually win 1 whole dollar and release a statement She regularly donates to charities visits sick fans and came under fire for donating money to Kesha s legal battle that also involved sexual assault She has money She just won a court case against someone that sexually assaulted her why wouldn t she donate to something that impacts her directly Especially after making a public statement that she would None of your comment makes sense 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Aug 15 20:24:58 2017|25|He probably wouldn t couldn t have paid A big part of his argument is that he s lost all his income because of her 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Aug 15 20:23:35 2017|83|People have already loudly claimed she s doing this for attention money Ignoring the fact that he filed the first suit that made it public as an attempt for him to get millions Her countersuit was definitely to make a point and she s still getting shit for being an attention whore money grabber People are so quick to make their own judgments without looking at any facts I m glad the actual facts support that it was just to take a stand 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Aug 10 11:10:54 2017|105|I don t think I was clear but I m from the south so many people really didn t want their kids talking about The Sex at all Including other health topics got more parents to opt in Abstinence only is awful but it at least discussed what sex was and the different forms that could spread STDs Still terrible but if religious parents wouldn t discuss it with their kids it was slightly better than nothing I don t disagree with anything in your comment just wanted to make it clear that I think it was to encourage some form of education among students 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Aug 10 03:28:12 2017|94|When they split the boys and girls up they show videos of how to check for testicular cancer and breast cancer Because that s obviously such a high risk for teens that it s a super important thing for them to get out of sex ed sBut seriously I think they included it so they could advertise it when they sent home the permission slips to parents and held the conferences for anyone that had questions Like it s not just about sex it s also about preventing cancer so more parents would approve 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 24 23:25:05 2017|275| You don t need to find a way the be a capital V victim He did something that you asked him not to and you can admit didn t harm you Implying she s looking to get attention by being a victim and it was actually harmless There are plenty of crappy people who do things that disappoint us and unless you truly feel that more needs to made of it I think the best thing for you would be to move past it and build something new with someone worthy of your trust Again as though she s being dramatic by asking a question to determine if his actions fell under a certain definition Even your recent response contains if how much you ve been victimized when that s really not what this post was about She knows she was violated It happened She s a victim and asking for clarification on whether his actions broke the law doesn t mean she magically becomes more or less violated I don t think you meant to come across as dismissive as you did and I understand where you re coming from in that she can choose what the next steps are based on what s best for her But you didn t answer her actual question of whether it is assault or not and even stated that it didn t really matter if it was You gave your personal thoughts on the matter and focused more on the relationship aspect but the tone came across as this isn t really a big deal get over it even if you didn t intend it that way 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jun 24 18:37:49 2017|252|If I knowingly drug you multiple times but you don t OD or realize I ve been drugging you because you think you just passed out you realizing that it is inherently fucked up and trying to understand the scope of those actions doesn t mean you re trying to make yourself a victim You are a victim of my actions Even if there were no physical damages there are very likely going to be psychological issues while trying to come to terms with what happened Someone she trusted and believed in took liberties with her body against her explicit wishes You may not understand how terrifying an unwanted pregnancy is for some women but the fact that he even put her at risk is incredibly violating Going back to drugging someone against their wishes even if they didn t get hurt someone made a conscious decision to risk that for their own selfish desires Knowingly risking someone else s health just because you feel like it is not and should not be acceptable in our society Realizing that it happened and seeing if there are protections in place against those actions is not trying to victimize yourself I get the main gist of what you re trying to say but you are very off the mark by making it seem like she s just looking for a way to get attention Edit also by documenting this behavior now she may be able help any future victims that do suffer physical damages
