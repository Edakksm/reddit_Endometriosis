TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 14:31:16 2017|224|I literally said it s not about antagonizing men so much as getting the specific subset of them who do to stop And honestly We do We do get over it I got over it when I was 16 when it started happening to me But it doesn t mean we shouldn t be talking about it because it obviously still happens Another thing I d like to note is the element of danger that women face when they are catcalled If they ignore people who do it there s still a chance some crazy person can still try to hurt them because their feelings were hurt because they were ignored Because in reality that s how much a physical power difference there is between men and women and it s why experiences like the one that OP had should be talked about If you want to talk about your issues I m up for it I want to open a discussion I ve struggled with my self esteem my entire life and it s only been fairly recently that I ve learned to really be okay with myself and my body So if you want to talk about what troubles you I m down It shouldn t be about men versus women It s about talking about things and gaining knowledge and understanding 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 13:54:48 2017|180|I can attest to the fact that I don t care how attractive a man is If they re whistling from a distance or shouting at me it is unwelcome and I scurry as quickly away as possible I m sorry you ve run into shitty people But the dialogue has never been all men are dangerous pervs It has always been please fucking stop We don t like it That s it And this post just attests to that OP did not like it when he got catcalled And now he understands how it feels Also as a woman I have also had people commenting on how ugly I am Honestly man get over it We can t help how we look We can t help our facial structure or what type of body we were born with If people treat you differently because of it fuck those people Find better people And if you run into strangers like that let them stay strangers Don t generalize the opposite sex just because you ve had a few bad experiences
