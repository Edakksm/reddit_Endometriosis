relationships|Tue Apr 24 12:36:25 2018|31|It sounds like he s flirting The punishment thing is him trying to make sexual tension I guess So he probably didn t mean it but he is a creep so
relationships|Thu Apr  5 17:01:37 2018|5| What a fucking pig thread
relationships|Thu Apr  5 14:29:53 2018|69|Well just stop giving financial support for his business ventures Then at the very least he s not actively draining money and eventually he won t be able to keep starting failed ideas So he ll either get a real job or quit spending either of which is a better situation and this way you don t have to force him to do things or risk a break up

relationships|Wed Mar 14 11:23:10 2018|83|It sounds like there s hope he seems to be capable of making changes to help you Id tell him how you ve been feeling and maybe see if it might not be best to quit talking to her after all he might be willing to if he knew how it made you feel Maybe he would be willing to go through the conversations with you which would make everyone clear on what really happened and what you guys should do going forward
relationships|Sat Mar 10 01:07:56 2018|26|I mean by that definition 100 of people are selfish and lazy protecting ourselves and not using excess energy is a trait of life in general
relationships|Mon Mar  5 02:41:29 2018|77|This isn t the whole story Just skimming your post history it seems like there s a lot going on and you might have been treating him like he was disgusting for a while maybe he started acting how you treated him You presented this story with the intention of receiving a one sided analysis that validates how you re feeling but if you re actually interested in making things better consider the role you both play
relationships|Thu Nov 23 00:37:27 2017|165|I can understand his idea that in his reality the country never existed He s saying that each person has their own reality unique to them because he argues existence is defined by thought I think therefore I am I mean obviously it s pretty weird he argued about it but I think that likely speaks more to the fact that he felt cornered because his idea was being misunderstood in an offensive way Like if I never heard of a sister and never found out she existed one could argue that in my universe she never did Obviously this construction of existence is debatable but I don t think he meant to imply there was a global conspiracy or at least not with the comment about his reality Basically I think he is thinking about things in a very abstract and existential way but is not necessarily crazy and probably what happened even if he is crazy is that he got cornered and panicked
relationships|Mon Oct  9 02:12:36 2017|80|I agree with that it s gross with the whole proxy for pedophilia thing but it is definitely better that it s drawings and by a lot Like that s the line between a monster that will be thrown in jail or chemically castrated and a regular old sexual deviant I agree with saying the kid drawings are bad but it s harmful to say that s equivalent to actual child pornography in which an actual child was sexually abused
relationships|Tue Sep  5 16:27:52 2017|83|I think you should talk to her about why she feels so uncomfortable with it so you can understand where she s coming from otherwise it s something you have to dance around forever Be careful not to do it so you can argue with her just listen and understand what she s saying Once you get down to the real issue you can think about how you and her want to solve it which may or not involve changing your Facebook habits
relationships|Wed Aug 23 12:50:11 2017|110|I mean if he is willing to support himself why does it matter to you what he does If he finds the current job stressful that s legitimate even if you don t feel the same He probably won t make any money youtubing so it makes sense you wouldn t support him during this but if he Is willing to work fast food I don t see the problem Of course if that s not the kind of person you d want to be with breaking up makes sense but if you like him for other reasons than his job I don t know why it couldn t work
relationships|Sat Aug 12 20:36:16 2017|73|I mean I don t know for sure but I d guess the problems run deeper He s probably annoyed at you in general not claiming it s justified It s like how when you were a kid you d get annoyed at your mom like breathing when you were in public Probably the best thing is to try to get to the core of it and see if that can be reconciled
relationships|Mon Aug  7 16:53:35 2017|101|He might just be getting really absorbed in it it doesn t neccesarily reflect negatively on how he views you not that it s ok to ignore you just that the game is really engrossing Shouting or getting mad might make him retreat more I think the best idea is probably to take him on a date and try to reignite personal conversation Hopefully he will remember what he s been missing I get engrossed in work or reading or stuff sometimes but when I have a real conversation again I instantly regret all that time playing suduko or whatever lol
relationships|Sat Jul 29 14:54:45 2017|39|This subreddit annoys me because obviously the person telling the story has a huge advantage You posting this shows you want people to tell you to break up with her so you ve already answered you re own question 
relationships|Wed Jun 14 22:55:14 2017|47|The top post anyways are usually that because this place is inherently voyueristic and those are the most dramatic even though they give you the least opportunity to provide helpful advice Honestly the place should just be called drama or something like let s just be honest
