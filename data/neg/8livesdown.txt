TwoXChromosomes|Mon Jul 30 06:43:46 2018|79|I once receive some good advice regarding job satisfaction Don t assess your happiness for the first six months At first you re new You don t know anything It s normal to feel miserable at first If after a few months you still dislike it it s time to move on Regarding being bored well We aren t paid to be entertained But it sounds like you have prior work experience What made the previous job more interesting

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 05:38:41 2018|96| if a women is raped by her husband nightly for a year in Sweden that is 365 rapesThanks That s interesting But I don t think that applies to this data For the simple reason that the Swedish figure is 65 5 100 000 compared to the U S which is 27 3 100 000 If the data was calculated as you described the figure would be thousands of times higher than you described Or we could both be wrong The data might be normalized in some other way Regardless it s an interesting insight Thanks 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 04:52:10 2018|62| The countries you listed have non citizens doing the assaults generally That s what Trump said about Mexican immigrants during his campaign Like him you ve made a blanket claim and provided no facts to support it OP didn t specify a rapist preference and it s bizarre and borderline racist that you would care about the rapist s country of origin 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 04:38:23 2018|99|Different people are offended by different things A man might find r twoxchromosomes offensive Which BTW is totally fine Chances are good he wasn t offended by every post But a subset of posts stood out as offensive which soured him to the entire subreddit It s equally okay if you are offended by r askmen I find it offensive when people use the term backstory to describe a person s past Fictional characters have backstories Real people have lives When two people are friends for years eventually one will make a casual comment that the other finds offensive

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 28 01:29:44 2018|168|These are all important topics but you re kind of all over the map Any one of these issues deserves it s own thread Maybe pick one topic and expand on it and offer supporting facts Example Endemic rates of sexual assault Then we look at the numbers and compare Even a single rape is one too many Turns out the U S rates are lower than Sweden Belgium and Australia but still nothing to be proud of Items to discuss and consider 1 Some countries are better than others at tracking assaults 2 In some countries even reporting sexual assault carries a social stigma 3 Some countries define sexual assault differently 4 The U S places 10th with 27 3 reported rapes per 100 000 But we all know that number is way too low So if we can t rely on statistics from the United States can we rely on reports from other countries Sexual assault is just one of the many problems you ve mentioned 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Jul 27 06:44:06 2018|113|Sorry about your asshole father I d like to spit your post into two sections and tackle them independently The first is the misogyny It s wrong It s bad for business Not much else to say on that When we read misogynistic comments we usually assume a man wrote it This idea becomes self perpetuating and self enforcing Turns out women also engage in misogyny and slut shaming Some say as much as men but it s not a contest so it really doesn t matter who does it more Hence we should fight misogyny where ever we see it but don t assume every misogynistic comment was written by a man

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Jul 21 04:36:06 2018|49|Your advice sounds like common sense and I don t think anyone on the thread will disagree I m sure it s crossed her mind It s the sort of advice that quickly comes to mind for other people s relationships but it s harder when its our own

TwoXChromosomes|Wed May  9 06:46:19 2018|188|Thanks 1 If I understand your answer to be incel you must be a virgin If you ve had sex once you don t qualify as incel I just wish that society would stop teaching that looks don t matter or that it s what inside that counts I ve never heard anyone say looks don t matter I don t care about overweight or ugly girls I d date them if How often do you ask people out When was the last time Also my social skills aren t that great but I d suggest you avoid calling them ugly Women consider 80 of the men ugly You kind of made that up I think But regardless of the actual number only a small percentage of people are deemed attractive That is the essence of attractiveness if everyone was attractive the concept of attractiveness would not exist Even conventionally unattractive women can open up Tinder and get unlimited amount of validation and sex Right Because women look for other qualities They don t base it solely on looks This doesn t refute my point it proves it

TwoXChromosomes|Mon May  7 07:17:46 2018|118| I give them a kiss then they ALWAYS have to pull me closer and try touching places I never gave any hint that it s ok For most people men and women alike The kiss is the hint that it s ok to proceed Kissing without touching sounds weird robotic and bizarre If you say stop he should stop But when kissing is initiated touching is normal The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results If this is happening repeatedly then you need to accept that it will continue to happen repeatedly You don t like what s happening You need to be upfront with your expectations Every movie

TwoXChromosomes|Mon May  7 04:09:50 2018|97| already paid rent for the month so he wants to stay until the end of MayThat s unfortunate but also reasonable It sounds like neither of you can afford to throw away money He s leaving end of the month It could have been much worse This gives you a unique opportunity to see his true colors so you ll recognize him for the asshole he really is If I were in your situation I d sleep on the couch or floor Is that fair No I d try to endure it for the next 25 days

TwoXChromosomes|Sun May  6 05:51:59 2018|116| I m scared I ll be seen as less capable or intelligent or faking it to other people and professors in the major if I do poorly on an exam or in the classes overallOf course that s going to happen That s the shitty world in which we live You must decide if you intend to fight it or crawl into a hole My girlfriend got an Electrical Engineering degree Even when she made good grades her male classmates dismissively said she only got good grades because she s pretty She has a job now And still sometimes she s talked over or not taken seriously You have to decide Keep fighting or give up 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun May  6 05:46:55 2018|67|1 They aren t your friends Stop calling them that You don t need a dramatic confrontation or showdown Just phase them out Stop going out with them 2 Another person suggested you lay of drinking and you sort of brushed it off You ve called your parents drunk multiple times for a ride It s great that you have supportive parents But this isn t healthy

TwoXChromosomes|Sun May  6 00:14:44 2018|119|Sorry this happened and I m glad it wasn t worse Every time I say be careful about drinking I always get accused of victim blaming So Here we go again I m not saying don t drink I m saying drinking diminishes our capacity It impedes our ability to drive or make decisions Compared to other animals humans are soft pink bags of meat No strength or speed No claws No venom We re pretty lame The one thing we have going for us is our gargantuan brains So large they actually complicate childbirth And when we drink we undermine the one thing we do well Think So when you drink please stay with someone you can trust 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat May  5 22:42:35 2018|27| I d just like to mention that I was quite drunk and him completely soberHe didn t drink at all but wanted you drunk That seems creepy

TwoXChromosomes|Wed May  2 06:53:20 2018|23|Well Not this specifically because photoshopping and porn websites are relatively recent developments But yes in general they ve gotten away with things 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May  1 14:25:34 2018|64|Because the world is a shitty place Everyone has the right to get drunk and not get raped But that doesn t protect us Be careful Everyone has the right to walk on the sidewalk and not get struck by a car But there s no force field protecting sidewalks and it happens frequently Is the pedestrian to blame Of course not Be careful

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 22:37:42 2018|96|I suppose that might happen but that doesn t appear to be what OP experienced Consider the following quote You re looking sweet do you need a boyfriend to Have you ever had an Englishman I ll take care of you Harassment was the result but not the intent for the simple reason that these men had nothing to gain from bullying or harassment Their goal was sex As bizarre as it sounds these men seemed to honestly believe they were flirting This was their A material I ll bet they rehearsed it in the mirror

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 19:12:35 2018|54|Not sure why you were down voted for asking a question Maybe someone thought it was rhetorical What deterrent could we provide Someone said its against the law in Holland Not sure of the penalty or how one demonstrates catcalling in court Invariably the defense will be a shrug I was just being friendly 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 18:44:25 2018|4|Agreed Lacking basic empathy 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 18:17:54 2018|100|Again that is precisely the point I don t think she actually used the term cat calling which is probably for the best Rather than discuss vagaries let s examine an actual quote You re looking sweet do you need a boyfriend to Have you ever had an Englishman I ll take care of you and ranged all over the place in between If you re defining this as cat calling I 100 agree Unfortunately it doesn t matter if we agree because neither of us are doing it Maybe being more specific won t help I don t know 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 17:38:49 2018|35|That s exactly the problem It is essentially sexual spam A very small percentage of women reward this behavior There are no negative consequences for offending the other 99 9 so they keep on trying 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Apr 28 17:25:15 2018|103|I think that was his point He never mentioned cat calling If we use Cat calling as an umbrella term to describe any undesired behavior there will always be a disconnect If someone knew there advances would be perceived as cat calling of course they wouldn t do it What would be the point What would they possibly gain I realize it sounds dismissive to describe it as flirting But ultimately that s what they are attempting Very badly like an eight year old boy who pulls your pony tail because he wants your attention and has no idea how to get it

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 04:28:55 2018|51|It s good that everyone else in the group recognized what he was doing and called him out I know that might not feel like much consolation but sometimes this goes on for years Some people are like that It might be gender discrimination Or he may just be an asshole

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Apr 27 04:18:07 2018|80|Not sure about the masturbating thing but secretly video recording is an instant relationship breaker This situation is hurting both of you No one wants to stay in a relationship with someone who can t stand them If you aren t having sex he s probably not too keen on the relationship either Talk to him He sounds more like someone who makes bad decisions than an outright villain I m sure you could reach an arrangement about the cats

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 06:40:32 2018|95|Painful memories exist because something bad happened and some part of us wants to ensure it doesn t repeat Example Grab a burning hot panhandle from the stove Every time I see a panhandle I experience a painful memory We call this a trigger The trigger exists to protect us from future pain I stop the memories from hurting by processing them I imagine how I would avoid such an outcome if I was again faced with a similar situation For me this the only way to avoid that helpless feeling Sorry about what happened 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Apr 26 05:13:19 2018|44| I learned a playful no could be part of the game But when I did mean it I watched men magnificent grown men not know the difference Christ why would anyone playfully say no and act surprised when people can t tell the difference

TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 00:17:51 2018|40|At the risk of sounding callous Considering she went there looking for a story on sexual harassment Considering she was there for ten hours She could have filmed the incidents She could have obtained more than a few vague quotes 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Apr 22 00:06:51 2018|122|Agreed At least I think It seems like people label anyone they disagree with as a narcissist If you think about it in a sense we are all born narcissists Self centered and expecting the world to revolve around us We are born helpless so of course our parents have no choice but to reinforce this notion Little by little we grow At some point we realize the world doesn t revolve around us That other people have feelings just like us At least some of us do But it isn t black and white In relationships we all struggle to balance giving and taking We don t always get it right But as you said relationships are work and take practice

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 24 07:05:10 2017|46|Kind of is If the show accepts male callers male callers will express their opinion Or alternatively she could simply give the guy a script to read and disconnect him if he deviates from her narrative On the whole I agree with her comments about tatcalling
