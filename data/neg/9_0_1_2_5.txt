relationships|Fri Jul 27 22:02:06 2018|481|2 years ago I was in a long distance relationship with one of my best friends We had met in real life we were in love and I was willing to risk it all to be with him Then 2 months into the relationship I caught him on Kik trying to get hooked up with other girls in his country so he could leave and have another SO to land on I confronted him on it and a few days after no talking we split I went no contact for a few weeks and came back to find less than a week after he left me he had hooked up with a co worker I was positive he wasn t really attracted to The fact is people that do this are extremely insecure co dependent and selfish Humans by nature are selfish and will always make moves they think that will best serve them Even if these moves aren t in the best interest of others or in the best interest of even themselves It s a painful thing to think about some people are not committed and jump around and some people commit without hesitation Finding someone on par with my ability to commit has been difficult and in your case it is difficult for you too What this girl has done to you is a reflection of her own insecurity selfishness and inability to remain loyal Your loyalty and your choice to stay with her speaks volumes about you in a good way As hard as it is to come to terms with moving on is the best option at this point Moving past such a situation is a long and difficult journey I won t lie When I went through my messy breakup 2 years ago I was also very depressed and anxious What brought me back on track was by focusing on things I loved furthering my success and making new friends I got an internship with a company in the industry I want to go into I pushed for better grades and the beginning of a resume and I met some really great people I still talk to to this day These things helped me move on even if I relapsed a few times Deleting photos going no contact and distancing yourself from people associated with her that don t support you is necessary Talking out what happened with people helped and seeing people shake their heads at my idiot ex made me feel better I knew I wasn t in the wrong I loved hard and he walked away That s on him Within 8 months time I had moved on enough such that I wasn t constantly thinking about him and wasn t in constant pain It s still a sore spot for me today but rebuilding trust in people and rejuvenation has begun

relationships|Thu Jul 26 00:37:22 2018|334|There are three possible scenarios that could have occurred Which one is most likely I don t know but here are the possibilities 1 She got a false positive 2 She was dishonest about her sexual past and has had dormant gonorrhea from a past fling 3 She was unfaithful In the event she got a false positive I don t think it would be wise to get back with her Clearly she has unresolved trust issues that she is unable to move past and as much as you love her it s going to put strain on your relationship Her jumping the gun and accusing you before even letting you have your say is an obvious red flag You guys are both young and in college and moving past a huge roadblock in a relationship if you guys decide to reconcile is going to be difficult Not only will you have had marred her trust in the past but she will have marred yours now At the you re both at it s more drama than it s worth In the event that she had a sexual past before you and was not completely transparent about it I also think it would be unwise to get back with her Not only did she lie to you but she was upset with you for doing the very same thing in the past Again another roadblock too large to surmount when you are both so young Lastly in the event she cheated it would be reasonable to assume you d end it with her for obvious reasons When she is back from her trip and you are both able to speak show her on paper from the doctor that you are negative for gonorrhea and more Then at that point you will have to decide how to go forward She either cheated and you need to end it or you ll request a redo and proceed from there about how to best go about matters
