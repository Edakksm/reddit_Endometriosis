TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 17:46:08 2017|93|I m not deaf either and I don t want to be touched my strangers even small quiet women It s not okay Touch your deaf friends who have given you the o k that that s an acceptable way to communicate With strangers using your words is best practice If people don t hear you speaking up or physically getting into their line of sight are much less physically violating No level of you being sick of hearing something makes it acceptable to touch people who may not want to be touched 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 16:55:36 2017|59|All I m hearing are reasons why you think it s acceptable or easier to touch people who may not want to be touched If half the time people don t hear you say excuse me then half the time you ll have to work harder to find a way to accomplish whatever your goal is without touching someone 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 16:48:11 2017|49|So you re saying that your wants and needs are more important than someone who doesn t want to be touched personal boundaries I know this is a notoriously difficult concept for reddit to understand but you really don t get to touch people just because you want to 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Dec 31 16:14:43 2017|17|I wish people would stop touching other people to get their attention This is also not okay 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Nov 11 16:23:27 2017|18|Honestly though things are probably gonna be really bad for that woman when she goes back to him 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Sep 11 14:58:24 2017|81| The worst is when you meet a new cool person and it turns out they just want to sell you leggings This happened to me once and it totally sucked Our coffee date turned into a mini presentation complete with laminated material about some nutrition bars Afterwards I texted and told her I thought we were meeting as friends not cause she wanted to sell me something and she kinda denied that s what it was but we never met again 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Sep 11 14:53:18 2017|73|I have a friend who s into all this and she s never once approached me I ve seen her It Works debit card and other materials related to shit she s been into in the past and she may have mentioned briefly in passing that she s doing this or that but for some reason she just respects our relationship and isn t trying to turn a friendship into a business relationship 
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Aug 30 04:18:23 2017|12|Thanks I needed this after another night where a passenger tapped me 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 21:51:12 2017|84|Obligatory not a parent but does your child ever go with their other parent Can you get a babysitter Have your child visit their grandparents Meeting new people and forming new romantic relationships with a kid physically by your side isn t realistic or at least will be much harder than the alternative If you want your life to change you have to make changes If you keep doing what you ve always done your life will be the way it s always been 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 21:28:34 2017|36|Get out more and talk to more people Make more friends non romantic because this will expand your social circle but also sharpen your interpersonal skills Go to museums bars clubs art exhibits plays arcades etc 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 21:24:57 2017|37|As a non parent who knows a lot of single parents it seems like every other weekend some holidays they have 100 free time and that is vastly different than the parents I know who are together 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 21:23:14 2017|23|IMO if she doesn t ask your opinion on it you re a good friend to support her while keeping your mouth shut 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 21:22:32 2017|20|I didn t see your OP but is it toilet paper residue Discharge that has collected in an odd way 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 21:20:10 2017|18|Pre cum contains sperm and can get a woman pregnant even if you don t finish inside her 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 19:05:22 2017|133|You keep mentioning yelling at someone to get their attention as if that s the only other option besides unwelcome touching I ll say it again if you are close enough to touch someone you are close enough to use your words Barring any disabilities deafness muteness choosing to touch strangers instead of speaking to them is poor form If you have issues with volume regulation and can t speak at at volume somewhere between normal speaking voice and yelling you still don t have a right to touch people for any reason flirtatious or otherwise You said you didn t know before this post that people found strangers touching them to be a beach of boundaries but now you do Hopefully you err on the side of caution and stop touching strangers 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 17:28:27 2017|25|I think I overstated my issue when I said I hate being touched in any way Accidental bumps aren t the problem deliberate touches are 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 13:45:45 2017|58|Why are you trying to solve my problem I didn t ask for suggestions on how to prevent this from happening in the future Are you a man In my experience men do what you re doing much more than women do No one especially not me needs you to tell me what to do to fix this 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 13:31:35 2017|39|I do too I feel a looooot of people I meet simply can t accept responsibility for their actions and when they re met with even the slightest criticism they lash out shut down or flat out deny facts 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 13:29:05 2017|22|I reject your premise that being touched at work is an occupational hazard I refuse to let you make this my fault 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 10:38:08 2017|17|I didn t choose my career poorly People like you who touch other people unnecessarily choose poorly 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Aug 25 04:42:11 2017|17|I m a flight attendant and tonight a passenger poked my ass cheek to get my attention 
TwoXChromosomes|Sun Aug  6 20:46:33 2017|63|does anyone have any tips on how to tell someone not to touch you when you re at work and they touched you in a non sexual way semi often i have customers tap poke or grab me because they have a question and i m walking by and i never know how to say don t touch me in a professional way 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue May 23 17:30:44 2017|151|How can you decorate wrong Was your partner commenting on how they would have liked things done and you took it as a them saying I m right and you re wrong I find that a lot of people men and women alike do this and that s what makes it so hard to provide feedback or have a conversation or be an inquisitive person Just because I would hang the banner 1 inch higher doesn t mean I m right and you re wrong It s just my preference and maybe if instead of getting defensive and taking it as a personal attack you the universal you could have a conversation we d all be better for it Now that I think about it I think the real problem is that most people do think that the way they do things is right so to have that challenged is difficult
