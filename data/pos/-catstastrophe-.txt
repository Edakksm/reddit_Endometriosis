relationships|Tue Jun  5 09:47:51 2018|65|It sounds to me like you guys need to get better at communicating But also you need to find things to do for yourself Go out for drinks with girlfriends start up with a hobby I bet you ll find yourself a lot happier when you have your own things to look forward to and you ll start feeling more secure all on your own 
relationships|Tue Jun  5 09:44:02 2018|123|First and foremost Always look out for yourself first ALWAYS I can understand the desire to help but you broke up with him for this reason and he took no steps to get better after you left or so it seems I know it s hard to just throw this under the rug but he s a grown ass man he should be proactively trying to get his life on track without your help I hate to say it because I know it s hard but I think you should leave him be Does he not have other family or friends Why is it YOU that needs to help him Good luck op I m sorry you re having to deal with this 
relationships|Thu May 31 10:09:48 2018|19|I am so sorry you had to deal with this my feelings hurt for you What a horrible bitch 
relationships|Mon May 14 17:51:02 2018|5|Came here to say this 
relationships|Mon May 14 17:29:30 2018|7|This made me really sad to read 
relationships|Wed May  9 00:58:42 2018|8|Than I seem to want to admit Ok 
relationships|Wed May  9 00:56:31 2018|18|Ok Then she should keep it to herself She s 16 she should definitely carry that burden alone 
relationships|Wed May  9 00:54:13 2018|16|Yes I totally agree But if she tells her mum at least she s not alone 
relationships|Tue May  8 11:01:24 2018|21|I think you should definitely tell your mum It s not fair for you to have to keep it a secret 
relationships|Tue May  8 10:49:06 2018|81|It really sucks that when there s a death in the family that everyone becomes obsessed with things of monetary value This hurts my heart that you re going through this I m so sorry I ve had similar issues in my family I find it sickening Honestly you and your young one are way better without those kind of people in your life Enjoy the house You obviously did something to deserve it The rest of them can suck it 
relationships|Tue May  8 00:33:06 2018|19|My heart genuinely goes out to you at this time Good luck in dealing with all of this xx
relationships|Tue May  8 00:27:05 2018|26|I think that s super sweet Though maybe have the drinks and snacks in the trunk ready to go so that everything is ready to go 
relationships|Tue May  8 00:20:52 2018|27|Oh man That would hurt my feelings too I think it would be best to talk to Trevor about it and see where it goes from there 
relationships|Tue May  8 00:16:57 2018|20|Aww That really sucks You deserved a better birthday If I were your friend I would have made it fun 
relationships|Tue May  8 00:06:26 2018|129|Huh I d be so furious if I came across something like that I know you don t want to talk to him about it but I would I obviously don t know for sure but it seems to me that he doesn t believe these things about you that he is just trying to play along with his friend Which is not cool obviously There have been times where my boyfriend tells his friends that I m not allowing him to do something simply because he doesn t want to do whatever his friend s invited him to do While I don t appreciate being thrown under the bus like that at least I know why he s said stuff like that Good luck Do keep us updated 
relationships|Mon May  7 17:09:30 2018|20|I think you should have her middle name as Ray It would be a nice father daughter bond for them 
relationships|Sun May  6 19:08:47 2018|35|He didn t ask to be brought into this world Why the hell are they billing him for raising him when they were the ones who climbed on top of each other and created him 
relationships|Wed May  2 00:16:02 2018|51|Agreed If someone talked like that to me when I was trying to help I d feel berated too I grew up in a household where I was spoken to like that on a daily basis and made to feel like a total idiot all the time Doesn t feel good 
relationships|Fri Apr 27 16:47:12 2018|8|YAY I was hoping you d update us

relationships|Mon Apr 23 23:25:20 2018|13|Agreed I was just trying to give some sort of explanation is all 
relationships|Mon Apr 23 20:55:43 2018|8|You re 17 and not 27 I hope 
relationships|Mon Apr 23 20:43:02 2018|28|This might not be the most insightful answer but maybe she s simply just going through a rough patch It happens to me sometimes I always pull through 
relationships|Mon Apr 23 20:10:30 2018|48|My mum had a similar situation with my step dad and his neighbour The only thing was the neighbour was MARRIED had and was an alcoholic didn t pay much attention etc My mum SHUT THAT SHIT DOWN And I believe rightfully so Good luck Keep us posted 
relationships|Mon Apr 23 20:50:09 2018|18|My 27F boyfriend 29M has no sex drive Is it actually his sex drive or is it me 
relationships|Sun Apr 22 16:13:12 2018|73|Abuse Abuse Abuse You cannot allow him to talk to you like that You don t deserve it No one does I do find that people on this sub always go straight for the divorce route and I won t tell you to do that but SOMETHING needs to be done because we only live once you don t deserve to be treated like that with the one life that you re given 
relationships|Wed Apr 18 01:01:52 2018|120|Obviously this isn t the same because I m using dogs as a comparison But I CAN T STAND DOGS My boyfriend has 2 So I move in with him and I m TERRIFIED of how this is gonna pan out cause I have NO patience for dogs I move in with him and end up loving the little shits I even take care of them a lot of the time Yes they annoy me lots but I still love them Basically I m just trying to say that things can work out People on here are being a little harsh But only YOU can judge the situation best Good luck OP Hope my example wasn t too awful haha 
relationships|Wed Apr 18 00:53:16 2018|26|I m inclined to agree with you Everyone is all LEAVE but I d proceed with caution hear her out see what happens and then decide 
relationships|Wed Apr  4 23:35:54 2018|11|In future I will definitely keep this in mind Thank you 
relationships|Wed Apr  4 23:25:57 2018|20|This wasn t drunken behaviour I planned to be there for a certain time and she changed it last minute

relationships|Wed Apr  4 22:20:02 2018|9|My 27F Mum 46F has put me on ignore
relationships|Mon Apr  2 20:58:18 2018|67|Dude What a shit situation I do have to say it is probabaly overbearingly difficult for both of you I do think though that if he loves you he will eventually come around I get that it s life altering but I know if my SO came to me with the news I d stick around and kinda hope for the same from him Good luck OP 
relationships|Sat Mar 31 01:01:35 2018|6|Keep us updated And good luck 
relationships|Fri Mar 23 18:04:29 2018|147|Sooo I am a self proclaimed crazy cat lady I had the bitchiest cat in the world and she only liked me and my mum But when I moved in with my ex she totally fell in love with him and it felt like she hated me She would sit on his lap wait by the door for him to come home etc and it honestly hurt my feelings Then when he and I broke up we were stuck sharing the apartment for a couple of weeks while we figured our shit out During that time my cat wouldn t even look at him Wouldn t go near him and she just sat by my side I like to think that cats bond with our SOs so much because they re trying to show us how much they love us by loving someone because we love them 
relationships|Thu Mar 22 23:41:12 2018|14|Sounds like she s got a problem with kicking She needs a leg removed

relationships|Fri Feb  9 17:35:41 2018|8|That s ok Thank you for your advice 
relationships|Thu Feb  8 14:00:16 2018|212| he dreams weren t even necessarily inappropriate I ended up making amends with him and having a conversation that brought both of us some closure We agreed to go back to no contact after that conversation because we were both in long distance relationships and it seemed like a lot of unnecessary stress for our respective SO s The dreams still happened a bit after that conversation but not nearly as much Can t remember the last time I had one now I honestly wouldn t worry about it too much Do a little bit of self reflection like are you thinking about your ex a lot during the day in real life Is there closure you need or you think he deserves and is this something you actively think about during the day If not then I would just let it go Sometimes your brain is just weird and wants to mess I just find it so irritating now I even had another one last night They re becoming more frequent I think it s because I am now more focused Reaching out to him is just not an option I think it would make both of us extremely uncomfortable and frankly I don t want to speak with him lol 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 22:03:56 2018|67|I very much appreciate this response because you can totally relate Full disclosure I recently saw a photo of him and his new girlfriend and he had taken her to Arizona for a vacation I felt hurt because he d never do anything like that for me when we were together It s not a monetary thing I still can t explain why I was so bothered 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 16:46:28 2018|17|Definitely don t want to reach out to him Thank you for your opinion that makes sense 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 16:45:49 2018|5|Yeah Fuck that guy haha
relationships|Wed Feb  7 16:44:07 2018|4|Fair enough Thank you

relationships|Wed Feb  7 16:33:18 2018|16|Me 27F with my boyfriend 29M of 1 5 years Keep having dreams of my ex 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 15:40:11 2018|51|I feel like the only thing you can do is be honest with her but not in a rude way Make sure she KNOWS you want her to have fun but that you re having these feelings Open communication is one of the best things in a relationship Best of luck 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 15:19:13 2018|42|I have to say that it wasn t a mistake because there was no way either of you could have seen that outcome I think it s a good thing you tried because now you know Best of luck in the future 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 15:06:22 2018|21|This might be a bit rash but hire a private investigator and in the meantime try to pretend everything is normal 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 14:36:12 2018|16|This sounds almost too simple and maybe even cliche But does your gut tell you anything 
relationships|Sun Jan 28 21:32:55 2018|6|Totally unsatisfying sex life Need advice
