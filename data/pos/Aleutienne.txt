relationships|Mon Feb 19 14:53:50 2018|86| My friend got accused of stabbing his coworker in the neck with a knife I m withholding judgment because I wasn t there to see the stabbing and he told me that she stabbed herself in the neck to frame him I mean that sounds totally understandable even though I know he s kinda got a problem with stabbing a lot of different people over the past couple years but not in the neck just like in the leg or back so like reasonable doubt right 
relationships|Mon Feb 19 13:41:32 2018|63|Ah yes there s more to the story but you don t know the whole story and don t want to make judgments but you ll admit he brought it on himself but it s still definitely on her too I think we hit the bingo in men who tolerate predatory behaviors from other men when it s not against them or theirs 
relationships|Mon Feb 19 12:11:59 2018|108|I don t quite understand how you can acknowledge that this guy chronically obsesses over women inappropriately and in the same paragraph dismiss him being dismissed from his job as due to her No dude it s not due to her he didn t get fired because she tattled he got fired because his behavior is hostile and inappropriate which you only seem to have recognized partially when it was levied against someone you care about This dude is a creep and a predator who has used you to source additional targets including your own girlfriend Get a clue and dump this dude He s not a friend 
relationships|Mon Nov 20 15:56:23 2017|225|Professional people in professional settings absolutely need to have a handle on the things they say and be able to diplomatically phrase facts in order to be constructive I get confronted with your Jim situation a lot I m being called to report on a task someone else is falling behind on Throwing said coworker under the bus is the woooorst thing you can do You look like a blame shifter who won t assume responsibility to your boss and your coworker suddenly hates you so good luck getting quality work on tasks 922 950 our of Jim So what if it s factual You ve got two people who hate you now Where is task 921 I ve got a few things outstanding with stakeholders let me check on the progress and get back to you in an hour You run over to Jim hey I m getting calls for an update What have we got here You pull together to get something to present and make a show of teamwork and responsibility to boss and Jim The realistic view is that if you re being expected to report on progress ON SOME LEVEL YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for that progress and for making sure contributors deliver on deadline If Jim isn t delivering that s not entirely on him it s on you too 
relationships|Mon Nov 20 15:45:59 2017|113| I told TWO people my closest confidantes with the door closed that I was thinking about quitting Of course word immediately got out Three people can keep a secret if two of them are dead This did not require anyone listening at doors one or both of your closest confidantes gossiped If you don t want to be gossiped about don t load their guns for them This is a you problem If you care about things being overheard stop talking about those things in the office Don t confide in office mates that you re thinking about quitting either find a new job and do it or keep your complaints to yourself

relationships|Sun Oct 22 13:09:45 2017|170|If you re a gold digger marrying some guy who was working minimum wage when you met and is only expecting a million bucks at some far future date when his parents die you re not a good one Close to a million bucks is a nice inheritance but not much more than a hope at this point might be a nice addition to a retirement but it s not changing your life here and now His parents could get sick and blow through it one could outlive the other remarry and redirect the inheritance or just blow through it the old fashioned way Would a gold digger stick through a middle class life for a million bucks at age 50 60 Your husband is getting pretty far ahead of himself He seems kind of up his own ass to be frank That money is not anywhere close to a reality for either of you and he s borrowing trouble and resentment from decades ahead and holding it against you
