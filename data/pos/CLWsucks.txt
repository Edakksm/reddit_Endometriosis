relationships|Tue Jun  6 13:44:50 2017|126|Went through this exact situation OP I even had a tattoo for my boyfriend that died It was very hard on me I never dated anyone in between He was fine with the pictures and such until about a year in and then he got drunk and cried and said he felt like he was competing with a ghost I cried too I kept some things but I put them away I ended up covering my tattoo as well Not for him but for me The situation was slightly different as my ex had killed himself and the tattoo was hurting more than helping Regardless he should try to be more supportive It s hard for him too but he can t be MAD at this
relationships|Mon May 22 14:11:12 2017|86|This is a thing My husband loves football and is an avid Colts fan I don t watch much tv but I feel like either they play amazing or they bomb horribly No in between When they bomb I know to leave the room and not talk to him for a while He doesn t yell or anything but he gets very upset and I know he needs a minute Sports fans can take things very personally at times Don t be too hard on her 
relationships|Sun Apr 30 01:59:48 2017|123|Okay so first of all staying together for the kids is never a good idea They always know Secondly breaking up when you have children is hard but you aren t depriving them of their dad If he s a good dad he will still be around I got pregnant at 19 I left my ex when my daughter was almost one We coparent She stays with my Friday Monday and her dad tue Thur We do Christmas and birthdays together It s possible to split and still have a family life It s not easy but it s possible My daughter now has a WONDERFUL stepmom and my husband is a pretty awesome stepdad if I say so myself There s hope
