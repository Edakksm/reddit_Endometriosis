relationships|Fri Oct 27 09:38:22 2017|297|well so I sent him a text because I am terrible at keeping my thoughts straight under stress on the phone saying that we got back together originally because he said I was the one and he would commit and try harder for us I was adamant that I would not get back together with him at that time if he did not step up And so in the text I also said that that was his time to prove to me that he valued our relationship and was trying and somehow it became me putting in all the effort just as it was before I said he may call me if it has something to do with our relationship but otherwise I did not see myself as being able to have a friendship with him or being able to give him another chance in the foreseeable future He called me fifteen minutes later to say that we d have to see each other so he can give me my things back He was listing every little article which I have come to learn is called hoovering So I told him definitely not just throw the things away and I ll move forward without him I honestly think there is some narcissism at play here I think he didn t want to give me my things back just to end the relationship I think he wanted to force himself into the forefront of my attention while I was vulnerable I think this because when I broke up with him the time before he stopped by my place to drop off a hanger like I was really missing that hanger do you think there is some validity to what I am saying or am I just going crazy 
relationships|Thu Oct 26 13:04:58 2017|109|tell me if this is petty but I read this article about relationship advice It says the best way to approach this if your ex gives you mixed signals is to flip the scenario on them and basically friend zone them ask them to run errands for you fix something etc etc Talk to them just in the same way like you would a friend It ll either fizzle out when he doesn t get what he wants if he has questionable motives or if it is sincere he will always stick around I m thinking like it s not necessarily a bad plan but maybe not for everyone 
relationships|Thu Oct 26 10:38:13 2017|129|I m going to ask this here because for some reason the thread I posted this question in got deleted and I really need to hear someone elses take on this He called me this morning not to talk about the break up but just to talk in general about what he has planned for the day his last midterm and to see if I was headed in to work and asking about my new job and the cat Am I the only one who finds this odd Why do you think this happened Does he not believe I am really breaking up with him or something Is he trying to keep a door open Is he that afraid to be alone Don t know how to take it 
relationships|Thu Oct 26 08:31:00 2017|73|Yes I am definitely going to need a lot of time to get over this one He called me this morning not to talk about the break up but just to talk in general about what he has planned for the day his last midterm and to see if I was headed in to work and asking about my new job and the cat Am I the only one who finds this odd 
relationships|Wed Oct 25 21:29:41 2017|224|yes mine texted me a little while afterwards It s not that I don t love you because I do and that was all like okay but what is this then We ve been with each other for years I offered to establish myself anywhere he wanted to be so it is not like I did not offer a solution to our having to change careers at similar times I would ve even done long distance with him if he d been able to give me some sort of idea or loose structure for what he hoped to see happen But I got nothing I realized tonight that the reason we had been having so much trouble making meaningful progress is because he was trying to prevent it from happening whether it was conscientious or subconscious I don t know I just am mostly upset I could ve been in a better place right now if I hadn t taken him back to begin with But I loved him and I trusted him when he said he was committed Now I am thinking he just got sick of being alone or maybe sick of other women he tried to date leaving him too I probably will never know I just cant wrap my head around it I would never have done that to someone
