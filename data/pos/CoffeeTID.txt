relationships|Mon Dec 11 17:53:06 2017|43|Oh stop it He takes pictures of fucking high schoolers and you re worried about her putting him in a headlock She should of beat his fucking ass in my opinion He ll be getting a lot worse than a headlock in prison 
relationships|Sun Dec 10 18:30:29 2017|120|When my boyfriend and I first started dating we d often lay in bed and talk about our pasts like who we dated things that happened to us etc I think it depends more on the type of people you both are There was never an issue talking about past relationships between the both of us I think honestly it s healthy to reach a point where you can talk about those things as it shows you ve reached a point in your relationship where you re ready and willing to accept one another s pasts But if you re not ready at this point and it s understandable after only 3 months reconsider your stance in a few months 
relationships|Sun Dec 10 09:30:13 2017|113|It s not even a matter of him not wanting you there anymore It s the fact that you completely violated his boundaries IN FRONT of his fiancee You got shitfaced and let out every pent up emotion regarding his unrequited love for you and did the typical why don t you love me drunk girl bit The probably is that this is a work function and not a club You can t handle your alcohol And what exactly were you looking to prove if he did accept your advances You re gonna date a guy who cheats on his gf His fiancee What exactly are your morals What exactly are your boundaries 
relationships|Sun Nov 26 12:19:51 2017|8|This is exactly what I think it is 
relationships|Sat Nov 25 08:45:43 2017|80|I don t think you should And also if you re able to develop a full on crush on another person while you re with someone else I d rethink your priorities Having a dumb little crush on the girl you saw on the train coming into work this morning is one this But you work with this girl If you really love your girlfriend and value your relationship you ll kill this dead asap This cannot go any further 
relationships|Sat Nov 25 08:38:39 2017|53|Think of it this way Do you want these people having anything to do with your future children one day No As soon as you and boyfriend get back home either break up or lay down some serious ground rules Personally I d break up because he and his family kind of suck 
relationships|Wed Nov 22 16:51:13 2017|153|This makes me never want to have children I seriously feel like 50 of marriages fail because either one or both spouses cannot adjust to the dynamic of adding a child into the relationship Children change you My father never adjusted to having kids and sounds a lot like your husband He ended up having a 12 year affair with some woman he met at a bar When my mother asked him why he said you weren t fun anymore after you had kids You changed And at one point my father blamed me for destroying his marriage with my mom basically because I existed You really need to sit down and ask your husband if he truly wanted children He can t do anything about it now but he needs to be honest with himself as to what having children truly means Otherwise he s going to end up being my father 
relationships|Wed Nov 22 07:01:04 2017|291|I can t remember if it was last Christmas or the Christmas before but my boyfriend and I got into a huuuuuge argument because I bought him hiking boots for Christmas he s a major outdoorsman He was broke and out of work at the time due to an injury He started this giant argument with me about how my buying him a gift is insulting to him because I know he can t get me anything how dare I buy something for him etc I put my foot down and told him fine you wanna interpret this as me trying to insult you rather than buying you something that will help you get the FUCK out of house stop drinking smoking sulking feeling bad for yourself then fine Fine Give it back and I ll return it The next time I saw him we had like a 2 hour conversation and he apologized and admitted he actually really liked the boots lol This issue with your gf is it seems like she thinks she needs to spend a lot of money on you She doesn t yet understand the usefulness and significance of clothes at Christmas gift cards small trinkets etc They don t always have to be an equal exchange I usually always buy my boyfriend a more expensive gift at Christmas time but that s because for the majority of our relationship he s been on the lower end of income But he makes up for it in other ways like being there for me loving me cooking taking care of our dog and driving us places Maybe I get him gifts out of guilt who knows but there are ways you can easily supplement an expensive gift 
relationships|Wed Nov 22 06:46:03 2017|22|Yeah but at that point the dude should have filed for divorce Fucking other women behind her back isn t the answer 
relationships|Tue Nov 21 21:19:54 2017|315|Are you 1 now though Do you feel as if you ve built a solid relationship with him When I first started dating my boyfriend I told him flat out I was not going to take our relationship seriously and it d probably be over a little over a year I wasn t seeing anyone else I was just scared shitless of commitment He was seeing someone in the early beginning who started fucking around on him leading him to take a random shot at inviting me over and striking up some dates 3 years later we have this incredibly strong inseparable bond If we go long periods without seeing one another we both get horribly depressed I m talking like 1 2 weeks we work off schedules We can both say with confidence we are each other s 1 at this point But can you say that about your bf To me it s odd he d admit this when Alyssa is now back in the picture In the past my boyfriend has openly admitted when prior flings have contacted him and asked him to get drinks and what not He was considering taking this one girl up on an offer because they d gone to school together and she just recently became a cop so he wanted to just go out with her as a friendly celebratory thing I wasn t comfortable with it at all but I told him it was okay 10mins later he texts me back saying Never mind me taking L out she just asked me to book a cabin with her for private weekend away Would your boyfriend turn his back on Alyssa and choose you if a situation like that came up I think that s the more important thing here But ultimately it s up to you to decide what your definition of deal breaker is 
relationships|Tue Nov 21 14:15:26 2017|51|She s not going to change Ever There s no reason for her to She doesn t care about the feelings of others clearly Otherwise she d second guess being rude to people for no reason Go see a lawyer It s time for divorce before children are brought into this 
relationships|Tue Nov 21 07:51:25 2017|80|I ve noticed a drop in my libidio since starting the pill too but it s more like a sex once or twice a week kind of drop I ve never been a sex driven person to begin with though and my boyfriend understands this and is okay with it But sex once every 2 months is an issue Ask her how she feels about sex She may genuinely be replused by it There are people who are sex repulsed 
relationships|Tue Nov 21 06:20:52 2017|67|Gonna be honest and say HSV 1 is almost as common as someone having HPV Something like over 50 of adults have it Even if you have HSV 1 yeah it sucks but even if you have no outward signs like a cold sore you can still pass it So honestly it s not the worst STD to have Just tell the next girl you re with 
relationships|Tue Nov 21 06:14:10 2017|13|I hope you realize you re in an abusive relationship Please leave him 
relationships|Fri Nov 10 07:32:29 2017|30|My boyfriend farts so loud at night he wakes himself up It s normal I fart when I sleep It s normal Just tell him You ll probably both laugh
