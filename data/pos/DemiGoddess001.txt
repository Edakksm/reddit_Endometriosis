relationships|Sat Apr  7 15:13:11 2018|372|Take a deep breath and relax Sorry for the wall of text When you do start dating someone and you want to bring your SO to a family gathering doesn t matter who s gathering you re including this new person into your family even though it isn t legally Who you date will affect your family You will want to talk about them and have them meet your family On that note it probably does feel to early to you and that is okay Express that to your Dad nicely because he is only trying to include you in on his decision making process My Dad was a little more cautious he had to be dating someone quite awhile before we were introduced and he always made sure that my time was prioritized because I was young about 10 11 when he started seriously seeing someone If I didn t like someone he would end the relationship because he saw that this woman was not going to fit into our lives From what you ve said that s all your Dad is trying to do he wants to see if this woman will fit into your new lives Now different people deal with divorce and breakups differently Some people go out and start dating sleeping with others immediately maybe your Dad is this way and other people choose to be single and be alone maybe your Mom is this way It s hard having divorced parents I was lucky to have two parents who desperately wanted to be involved all the time It sounds like both your parents are the same way You are so lucky because many people with divorced parents don t have that I know it s frustrating now and it will be for a while but apologize to your Dad for what you said even though it s how you felt at the time or even now There are just some things better left unsaid sometimes because it s hurtful If you d like to talk or even rant about anything you can message me I may be 28 now but I vividly remember how frustrating this can be and still is more than 15 years later 
relationships|Sun Feb  4 20:00:40 2018|81|My dad had ALS and brain damage from carbon monoxide poisoning and some Parkinson s traits but I can t remember if he had it or not I tried to spend as much time with him as I could His memory started going in the last few years He also got ornery but he always appreciated spending time with me Your dad is getting more loving and you should take advantage of that while you can You won t regret it
