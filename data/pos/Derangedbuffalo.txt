relationships|Wed Jun 27 11:10:04 2018|117|I m so sorry for your loss I m so glad you have a supportive network of friends and family behind you who are able to give you some comfort during this hard time I think that the complete lack of sympathy and support from your boyfriend is evidence that this relationship has burned out Partners are supposed to support one another and all he seems to do is make excuses Tell him that you re disappointed that he was unable to be there for you in a time of great need that you ve realised your worth to him and that his work relaxjng on his own schedule is more Important than being there for you 
relationships|Wed Jun 27 10:51:44 2018|143|I can t even begin to list all the possible things that could go wrong if that 13 year old was to attend that beach party Drunk just teens and water is a big no Being on a beach with no adult supervision is a no You don t know who the heck could be around at that time I wouldn t even allow my child to walk home in the dark in this day and age Yes it is hard fitting in but potentially risking so many dangers is not worth it Your wife has no right to tell your cousin how to parent Do you have children of your own If you don t I can perhaps understand how she would be so nonchalant about it If she does please don t let her allow your kids to do such things 
relationships|Wed Jun 27 10:46:35 2018|115|My dad would be my safe haven if it came to that As we have a child I m trying to work things out before ending things I m not just doing it for my son I do truly love him I think he has just lost his way a bit and with this new friend who is a bad influence encouraging him he s struggling to get back I m not one who gives up easily I just felt like I was over reacting and being dramatic but all of you lovely people have made me realise that I m right and it isn t fair for me to be expected to do everything 
relationships|Wed Jun 27 10:44:24 2018|78|I think it s more the commute he has to be up at 6 30 and leave the house at 7am then he doesn t get back until 6pm Even so I definitely don t think that should prevent him from being a father and cleaning up his mess I have to stay home as we can t find a daycare the least he could do is not act like another child I have to take care of
relationships|Wed Jun 27 10:42:36 2018|105|I ve had a good heart to heart explained that even though I don t have a paying job I still work damn hard to care for our son and house and that what he doesn t understand is my day doesn t stop until my son is in bed and the chores are done He s agreed to contribute more to both parenting and housework I haven t asked him to clean the entire house etc it would just be nice if he could clean up a mess he sees instead of pointing it out to me or waiting for me to do it 
relationships|Wed Jun 27 10:40:47 2018|6|Thank you I really appreciate it 
relationships|Wed Jun 27 10:40:25 2018|99|Thank you for this I gave him the ultimatum yesterday I think by my tone of voice and body language he knew I wasn t joking around I ve given him a chance to change actually act like a father and a partner and stop treating me like a housemaid I ve also spoken to him about his friend he s agreed to stop smoking the weed so much and stop seeing his friend so often I m hoping he will start pulling his weight if not for the sake of our son for the sake of my sanity 
relationships|Wed Jun 27 09:56:33 2018|97|I don t think it s your place to tell other family members about it I feel like that would just cause arguments and he would lose trust in you The only thing you really can do is try and encourage him to see the bigger picture that it may seem amazing now but things could turn sour and if that happen she had access to all his money and can cause a lot of havoc If he still doesn t listen that is his problem and he will have to carry the burden of those consequences 
relationships|Tue Jun 26 09:10:42 2018|80|I can t understand his frustration with you never fully completing a task especially if he is particular with cleaning and having things in order But I can also see your frustration with him nit picking I feel like if soemthing that small bothers him so much and he notices it and you haven t he should just put the damn potatoes away himself instead of collecting loads of little things you forgot to do and criticising you for it 
relationships|Tue Jun 26 08:53:21 2018|58|It s your body those are your eggs and I think you are considering doing a very selfless thing that could completely change someone s life for the better I don t see why he would consider that stressful The only impact it would have on him is him having to wear a condom That seems very immature 
relationships|Tue Jun 26 08:50:47 2018|127|I think I would have a conversation with your girlfriend I wouldn t outright say your best friend has a thing for me more that her body language and demeanour with you has changed since you were kind to her and that certain looks she s giving you are making you wonder if in her vulnerable state after a break up that she might be taking the kindness a different way as she obviously hasn t been treated nicely like that in a long while I feel like if you don t talk to your girlfriend she may end up thinking you instigated things and it could get messy Even if you think you might be reading into things too much it s better to be honest
relationships|Tue Jun 26 08:42:39 2018|86|Gosh you made me cry I feel like the whole 2 years we ve faced struggles and we finally catch a break and it s like he doesn t even care I don t want to go back to my mum s she put me through years and years of emotional abuse and caused me to spiral into depression and anxiety It was hell living there But now I m starting to feel how I did there taken advantage of Isolated and I just feel lost 
relationships|Tue Jun 26 08:14:43 2018|24|I f 21 am fed up of my partner m 23 not helping with our son or house and giving me the cold shoulder
relationships|Tue Jun 26 07:41:25 2018|26|I f 21 am so mentally drained from being the only one putting in any effort with the house and relationship with my partner m 23
