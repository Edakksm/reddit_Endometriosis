relationships|Fri Sep  8 14:50:51 2017|290|Pretty much constant reassurance is key even if it s not out right just staying patient can make the world of a difference and letting him KNOW you ll be patient with him can mean a lot to someone with PTSD Personally for me my PTSD can hit out of nowhere at any time depending on a certain noise or smell Do what you can to read up on it and let him know that you want to know what you can do to help him if he s ever in a situation where he has a PTSD moment That right there lets a person know you re invested and care because everyone has different things they need during an episode For someone with this much self doubt and trust issues it s going to take a lot of work but if you care about him I think it will be worth it It s definitely hard I m not going to sugar coat it But reassurance showing that you re interested in helping being patient are all things a person like this needs Warning signs for PTSD can vary for person to person so again you need to communicate with him and can do so by letting him know you care for him and want to be there for him no matter what but that you can t help him if he s not talking to you I wish I had more advice but it s really going to be about you two working together keeping communication open and working on ways in which to tackle this TOGETHER so he knows without a doubt he s not alone in it and that YOU aren t alone and frustrated either 
relationships|Fri Sep  8 04:06:29 2017|170|It honestly sounds like he just needs space if it becomes excessive then I would worry Give him space but also do little things to let him know that you re supporting him and thinking about him actions speak louder than words and if he doesn t turn down those actions I think you re in the clear and it really is just him needing space to sort his thoughts and anxiety from PTSD and the family situation I have PTSD myself and when I get into a mood as I call them I want to be left alone but I m so lonely if that makes sense and being reminded that I have someone that acknowledges that I m going through a hard time makes all the difference through little actions ask what his favorite take out is and have it delivered to him etc When he s ready to see you just be there for him and don t pry He ll tell you when he s ready 
relationships|Fri Sep  8 03:56:36 2017|97|You need to ask her how she feels about it Also be prepared if you two start dating for there to be inevitable awkward situations where he may cheat on you with your sister since they ve already had a fling and vice versa ask for a threesome It s pretty disrespectful in general in my opinion and usually when a person says yes you have to keep in mind that at one point they had feelings for that person that may or may not have gone away and that can ruin your relationship with your sister 
relationships|Fri Sep  8 03:54:27 2017|370|You need to take into consideration that just because you want to settle down doesn t mean that he HAS to or NEEDS to the relationship can still work if you two are willing to make it work but sometimes people want completely different things He seems to like his job and most people aren t willing to let go of them just because of someone they re dating I wouldn t do it either Instead of making him leave his job why don t YOU move to where he s at Or is he against that as well It s not that easy to uproot your whole life You both sound like two people with two very different wants in life and that s okay what s not okay however is forcing another person to share your wants You need to respect that he may not want kids or that he may be the kind of person to always be career driven If you don t think you can handle that you both need to go your separate ways because habits around this age rarely change and it s hard to change a person s core personality and beliefs ESPECIALLY when it comes to something as essential as a job you need to LIVE Children have been the ultimate deal breaker in most relationships I ve seen fail and chances are he probably won t ever really want children but would instead feel pressured into having them That s not a way to have a relationship or start a family You need to find someone that wants children that wants to be around you and who is willing to compromise Leaving a job is asking too much IMO same with asking someone that doesn t want kids to suddenly want kids If he hasn t wanted to be serious in over 2 years I doubt he s going to change much It doesn t mean he doesn t love you but again you can t get mad at someone at this point for not changing when you already know how they are He s as committed as he can be but you can find someone to fit YOUR needs 
relationships|Fri Sep  8 03:47:21 2017|131|That can be very offensive to say to someone that s obviously uncomfortable about their masculinity and shy to boot Especially if you re early on in the relationship you re making it very hard for him to feel either A comfortable or B unjudged Gay jokes are fine and dandy when you ve been dating a while but if it s something that obviously bothers him you don t get to decide that it doesn t TL DR it sounds like you ve messed with his self esteem people don t get good at sex over night especially if he was a virgin which it sounds like he might have been if he s that upset over the jokes you constantly telling him that he s basically horrible at sex 
relationships|Fri Sep  8 03:44:10 2017|75|Let her know that without criticism that she s never going to improve However there are ways to give constructive criticism without saying outright that it s horrible Just tell her that you need her to be more open to receiving that criticism maybe even make a dish of your own and have her critique it so she understands a little better that you re not doing it out of spite but to genuinely improve 
relationships|Sat Aug 26 00:50:21 2017|37|You executed a lot of self control a lot of people don t have you obviously cherish your relationship with your husband otherwise you wouldn t be trying to make things work You did the right thing 
relationships|Fri Aug 25 02:37:14 2017|73|You don t want them to be sad and lonely the rest of their lives but they have each other You deserve to be able to be happy and not lonely too whether that entails dating a woman Your parents will be gone one day and you ll be left with the life you built for yourself Please don t let it go to waste just to appease them while making yourself miserable 
relationships|Fri Aug 25 02:33:45 2017|40|I wouldn t worry too much about saying no your nephew is going to be 18 soon and able to make his own decisions He won t stop wanting to be around you because you said no to a tattoo 
relationships|Mon Aug 21 03:05:45 2017|33|Best bit of advice I have on people in general is if someone says they re hurt they re hurt You don t get to suddenly decide that you didn t hurt them
