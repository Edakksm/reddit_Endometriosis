relationships|Sun Jun  4 03:34:00 2017|164|Hi OP I grew up in your daughter s exact position except my mother left my Dad when I was 14 Please believe me when I say this is only going to get worse for your daughter My Dad only targeted my Mum until around the time I hit puberty and then I was also fair game It may not be physical now but it has serious potential to get that way My Mum didn t leave my Dad until after he threw a glass bottle at my head which could have done serious damage if it didn t miss The older she gets the worse he will treat her because he knows she s getting to an age where she won t be under his control any more Please for the sake of your daughter leave this man Emotional abuse takes a lifetime to recover from especially when it happens to you when you re very young You both deserve so much better
