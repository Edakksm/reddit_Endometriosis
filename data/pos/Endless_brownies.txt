TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 15:04:50 2017|178|Thank you friend and that is actually a great idea I was hesitant initially to try cloth pads because I was afraid that the blood would just spill over the sides but I m running out of options so I should definitely try Thank you so much for the tip That s a great idea and thank you for the clarification that some have and some don t have plastic I d definitely go more along the lines of no plastic I d also love to try organic pads if I weren t also allergic to adhesives but thank you so much for the suggestion I m glad to hear that you ve found something that works for you I ll definitely look at r clothpads And that is great news about the ruby cup Thank you so much I ll also give that a try Omg bless the shit out of your lovely soul TIL and yesterday I learned as well r twoxchromosomes ladies are much better at gynecology than some licensed professionals Lol Thanks again friend 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:56:36 2017|8|That s kinda how I was feeling too 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:56:15 2017|133|Thank you so much for that confirmation I also felt like it was unethical I m struggling with it because I know she cared and was trying to help but she was so hurtful and aggressive with her opinion I don t want her to get into trouble I only just want her to change her approach I m sure that she has a lot of knowledge on the technical parts of her job so I really want her to use that rather than her shitty judgemental advice you know What is the college of physicians I m sorry I definitely want to follow your advice on this but I don t know what that is but if you can tell me I ll do my best thank you again for the help 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:51:42 2017|64|Man bless your soul 3 I ll definitely try that That allergy sounds like hell though oh man I m so sorry And good idea I ve been hesitant to try reusable cloth pads cause I m afraid the blood will just spill over the sides but I m definitely running out of options so I ll 100 give that a try Thanks lovely 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:49:23 2017|37|Diva cup I also have trouble with silicone but my doctor said it was probably the traces of latex I m not sure I have trouble getting a straight answer when it comes to my reproductive shit 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:47:41 2017|55|Right Like I don t want to wait years I have pain now Like exactly Some things you can t wait on to test I appreciate her being cautious but again she was being incredibly condescending and insensitive in other areas so there wasn t much point to her being cautious in only 1 area 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:23:19 2017|38|Omg GIRL you are making my day The comment section aside from the few assholes is actually so blessed and sweet also I LOVE your use of the phrase pile of quivering goo THANK YOU YOU TOO LOVELY

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:13:09 2017|22|I think that s the one I tried if it is it only accepts American doctor reviews But I ll check again 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:10:22 2017|51|Oh yeah cause no one has their lapse days when they feel like shit What s with your unnecessary vendetta against me I ve done nothing to you aside from rightfully telling you to fuck off Which I would like to bring forth again Thanks for all the name calling though 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:01:41 2017|6|Oh you again Fuck off please 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:00:53 2017|244|Thank you I m white but good thought That s really shitty to hear that doctors treat you differently automatically based on race that s dumb and completely fucked up girl That sounds like an amazing class actually Good luck in it I bet it s really interesting disturbing And ex actly You get it Thanks so much you too I hope you stop being profiled based on race that s complete fucking bullshit for them to do to anyone And thank you for the tip I m actually also allergic to the adhesive bandages are always fun too so I ve pretty much sworn off of pads I tried a cup but I m allergic to the traces of latex in them so I also get a rash with those god doesn t want me to be able to deal with my period evidently period panties also give me a rash because they dig into my skin but I ll try a different style size and hope for the best I ve found some solace in organic tampons but the applicators are super tricky and I end up only being able to get them in 50 of the time and then I can only use them for an hour or so before they start to hurt So for the time being that is my best option but I won t necessarily be able to afford them forever since they re far more expensive 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:45:15 2017|50|Yes exactly I don t wanna make her life harder just her other patients lives easier And exactly I just want it to be brought to light so that she knows that she fucked with me and probably multiple other patients So she changes her way of going about things 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:41:05 2017|2|Ily 3
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:28:57 2017|3|Fuck off actually 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:28:15 2017|63|Yeah I definitely need to see a gynecologist but she s not the one Just sucks that I ll have to wait another few months oh well I don t need her bad vibes Oh and I have a few tips regarding where she can shove her opinion I kid I kid but seriously I plan very hard not to see her anymore 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:24:53 2017|8|Bless you I m gonna do this 3
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:23:39 2017|129|I love you and exactly If I tell you I m fine I m fucking fine Just do the tests Like even 15 mins of explanation then a test would be fine but an HOUR of lectures and judgement No Like sorry lady I don t want this And probably man like I didn t understand all the judgement Like you can be concerned without being judgemental ily 3 you are also a hella worthy person 3 I am not gonna let her get away with bullying me It 100 was passive bullying too She used her position of care to shame me She made that perfectly clear when she said I must feel like a freak whilst implying that I have something to feel like a freak about 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:18:13 2017|82|Right Yeah I m calling the hospital tomorrow And me too man I m cheesed that she made me feel so shitty Like who says to their patient you must feel like a freak I don t know about the medical board thing I ll look into it I m gonna make sure that she knows she was wildly unprofessional and assholy I don t wanna fuck her over but I wanna make sure she doesn t do this to anyone else 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 00:51:09 2017|80|Right What was accomplished by that appointment Nothing I m glad to hear I m not crazy for being rattled about this She was very very unprofessional Part of me feels guilty if I get her in trouble because she s a single adoptive mum which isn t easy not sure why she told me this but also my past week has been hell honestly She shouldn t be allowed to do this to people I definitely will report her 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 00:46:24 2017|217|Yay that s great to hear And it s okay it s what the medical system is I m just lucky my body has my back lol And YES Cannabis for OCD is so underrated My compulsions are so much less agonizing when I use my CBD It puts them on the back burner for sure I m so glad you ve found cannabis as well And yes exactly It s a medication that grows here naturally Like lettuce It s good for you Even with the thc I only use CBD it s still not bad for you and certainly not as bad as the benzos they gave me before I got CBD Yes exactly However if it was a fresh trauma they way she went about it also would have just fucked my head right up Even if she had done it the more right way she still would have been doing it wrong And that s true honestly I should have done that so many times but it never felt right to sue the hospital but I never thought of the individuals And not even for the money literally only for the fact that I could have easily died while in care and they didn t care She definitely needs to be held accountable 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 00:39:19 2017|20|I painted her exactly as she acted but thanks she s clearly not the right doctor to be a doctor 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 00:38:25 2017|29|So hip so edgy and actually so true I could see it And I ll ask my actual doctor next time I see her thanks for the advice 3
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 23:17:15 2017|5|Enjoy your lack there of 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 23:02:13 2017|10|Will do I ll call the hospital tomorrow most likely 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:54:06 2017|12|Yeah I m angry because you verbally attacked me Thank you though 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:41:06 2017|7|Damn Okay we ll get separate pizzas 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:40:20 2017|232|YEAH THE KIDNEY THING I had chronic kidney problems for MONTHS Peeing blood collapsing constantly the works They did nothing and I drank hella water and cranberry juice and it somehow went away but yeah recovered addicts are definitely written off the second it s acknowledged that they ve injected a mariguana I hope your kidneys are good now Bless you omg You fucking get it And exactly Marijuana is the only medicine I ve ever been prescribed that hasn t either sent me to the doctor or somehow really fucked with me I don t see how they can know all of that and still say that it s bad for me like a doctor gave it to me it s already been prescribed can you please turn a blind eye to that the way you do to my healthcare needs And bless you I totally thought she was crossing boundaries but I was second guessing myself which I shouldn t do I know I can t trust the system I should have thrown her on the ground lonely island style lol And YEAH Like THEY GO TO SCHOOL TO LOOK AT VAGINAS WHY CAN T THEY JUST DO THAT lots of people want to look at vaginas and then send the girl home but people who ARE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT FOR A LIVING CAN T EVEN DO IT RIGHT 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:30:30 2017|3|Perfect What toppings 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:25:41 2017|54|Thank you so much for that I ve been kind of torturing myself with this thinking it was stupid but you re right it s the default to trust doctors especially your first time She abused her power to feel high and mighty The hospital will most definitely be getting a call from me 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:23:49 2017|12|I owe you guys all one too We should all get pizza 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:23:08 2017|302|YES you get it Thank you This is exactly how I m feeling I m so sorry to hear that they do that to your fianc too I was right on the verge of death for almost a year due to their negligence and their assumptions that it s just my mental health or drug abuse and for them it doesn t matter because if I died they could have easily said oh her body could no longer take the damage of the drug abuse and it would be written off much easier than if a different patient died Even now every doctor s visit when they hear I m on medical marijuana I get the ole lecture about how it s bad for me as if pharmaceuticals haven t nearly killed me several tens of times Bless you and your fianc it s tough but I m glad he has you for support and I really wish good luck to him in getting ACTUAL HEALTH CARE I seriously wish you two all the best 3Also in response to your second paragraph I m seriously tearing up thank you so much you kind stranger 3 you re right there s no room for judgement or self richeousness especially in the medical system And I m so sorry that happened to you friend that s complete fucking bullshit that a doctor would do that Like not cool of her at all Like your job is to look at vaginas why are you trying to shame me when all you are supposed to do is LOOK AT OUR VAGINAS Like come on it s really upsetting that these professionals have the access to women to bully us and shame us I m glad there are good people like you to contrast these Bitch faces
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:09:28 2017|22|That makes sense But yeah I definitely think she was trying to be like yeah I get you I m hip too 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 22:08:26 2017|308|Pardon None of that is her job She spent an unnecessary amount of time focusing on things I don t need to tell her more than once that I m not engaging in those behaviors anymore I understand her asking about those things because they can be relevant but she went beyond giving professional advice and gave psychiatric advice which she is not supposed to do She should have run tests because that is her job She gave me no medical advice other than mental health stuff and stop shaving and use coconut oil on tampons I got the rashes before I started shaving and shaving did not make the rashes worse which I explained to her AND explained in the post I told her ALSO that I have tried the coxonut oil thing and it didn t work She gave me only advice to try things I ve already tried so it s not that I refused it s that I told her in my experience those things do not work The shaving has nothing to do with my allergies She told me to stop shaving I reminded her that I didn t always shave and even before shaving my problems were the same so the shaving part is not relevant She should have done more than the STI tests since I didn t go to her with I m fucking oozing I went to her with my periods have been painful and erratic since I was a 12 year old which has nothing to do with STIs Who the fuck are you to assume I wouldn t take a diagnosis She can t diagnose me with shit if she doesn t run tests which she didn t There are more things gynecologists cover than STI tests eh I d suggest knowing that before talking about gynecology 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 21:58:00 2017|81|Yeah that s how I m feeling I ll definitely complain to the hospital I m not exactly sure how to do the other 2 things but by the grace of god I m gonna do my part to make sure she doesn t do this to anyone else And I m not sure if we have planned parenthood here but I ll do some researching for somewhere else I could go that s also covered Thanks for the advice 3
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 21:54:08 2017|30|No I m white I live in Canada I assume it was her trying to talk hood talk teen as an attempt to relate to me if that makes sense 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 21:52:19 2017|53|You raise some very good points I ll definitely contact the hospital I might even send a link to this post because it s all neat and tidy in one place or send a copy that s more sheared down to be more professional Yeah the second one s probably a better idea 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 21:50:29 2017|7|Smart as fuck actually you re great 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 21:49:31 2017|24|Thank you 3 I will definitely do that I would hate for her to do that And she should not be mentoring a student 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 21:01:17 2017|49|MD Licensed gynecologist but I m wondering who let her get her license I feel kinda dumb for even engaging I just honestly assumed this was how gynecologists are which is stupid in itself but I talked to my ma about it and she was like what the fuck 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 20:59:06 2017|58|Good idea Thank you I m definitely going to do this Another comment suggested a google review which I also liked the idea of but I couldn t figure out how to do it anonymously and I don t want my face to be attached to such sensitive info if that makes sense I ll definitely call though 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 20:50:26 2017|18|Ily 3 can you review people who work at the hospital I ve never google reviewed anyone sorry 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 20:41:06 2017|20|My gynecologist bullied me into feeling like a broken woman and then sent me home after doing no tests Wtf 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 16:18:40 2017|103|My dad got me mini eggs and chocolate coins cause I was so scared It made the whole thing much less traumatic Something about someone else realizing it sucked but trying to make it a bit better really helped Especially when back then they were 14 days long and I had to change my night time maxi pad every half hour every day of my cycle celebrating that seems a little odd but flowers and ice cream or chocolate or even a new pair of panties and a quick lesson on how to get blood stains out of stuff really soften the blow 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 21:31:45 2017|35|It s been a colourful one that s for damn sure Thank you for the kind words my friend hope you re doing well and yeah I m getting that sense too to be honest

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 21:58:00 2017|81|Yeah that s how I m feeling I ll definitely complain to the hospital I m not exactly sure how to do the other 2 things but by the grace of god I m gonna do my part to make sure she doesn t do this to anyone else And I m not sure if we have planned parenthood here but I ll do some researching for somewhere else I could go that s also covered Thanks for the advice 3
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 21:54:08 2017|30|No I m white I live in Canada I assume it was her trying to talk hood talk teen as an attempt to relate to me if that makes sense

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 20:59:06 2017|58|Good idea Thank you I m definitely going to do this Another comment suggested a google review which I also liked the idea of but I couldn t figure out how to do it anonymously and I don t want my face to be attached to such sensitive info if that makes sense I ll definitely call though 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 20:50:26 2017|18|Ily 3 can you review people who work at the hospital I ve never google reviewed anyone sorry 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 20:41:06 2017|20|My gynecologist bullied me into feeling like a broken woman and then sent me home after doing no tests Wtf 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 16:18:40 2017|103|My dad got me mini eggs and chocolate coins cause I was so scared It made the whole thing much less traumatic Something about someone else realizing it sucked but trying to make it a bit better really helped Especially when back then they were 14 days long and I had to change my night time maxi pad every half hour every day of my cycle celebrating that seems a little odd but flowers and ice cream or chocolate or even a new pair of panties and a quick lesson on how to get blood stains out of stuff really soften the blow 
TwoXChromosomes|Sat Feb 17 14:20:21 2018|35|Maybe learn that some people have no choice Be it because of rape or because they re forced to sell sex to pay for food or whatever it is sometimes there s no real option

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 21:30:31 2017|111|Thank you friend and oh yeah it was hard to keep calm let me tell you But I knew raging would worsen things because she s further blame my mental health for everything when I was trying to prove that I m stable which I should not have had to do in the first place as we all know I m sorry to hear that you and your ma were also fucked over by the medical system You are completely right we just get talked over and patronized I hope one day doctors cut that shit out and I m gonna do what I can to make sure this doctor does 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 21:27:06 2017|29|Bless you I m so happy to hear that there are empathetic lovely people like you working with survivors and thank you so much I ll definitely do that 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 21:25:29 2017|11|Yeah she doesn t sound too likeable And that s great

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 16:02:08 2017|39|That sounds awful What a dumb piece of shit she was eh Geez I will definitely see another doctor I can see why she wasn t well regarded in the medical community I hope you re doing better now 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 15:11:06 2017|67|I have not but I do have issues with silicone I know it s rare an I am definitely planning to see an allergist I m waiting on an allergy testing appointment actually But like silicone toys and things also give me problems so whether it s an allergy or a sensitivity something about silicone my body does nottt like Thank you so much for the advice 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 15:09:11 2017|30|Weird Man I m starting to think I should go to the doctor with a much more aggressive attitude cause I can NEVER get ANSWERS Thank you for the info 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 15:07:49 2017|33|Thank you you re definitely right there I feel like she used our meeting as a power trip We have a lot of doctors here that are like that And I plan to 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 15:06:27 2017|25|That s actually an amazing idea thank you so much I ll ask my trauma therapist if she knows anything about that Bless you omg 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 15:04:50 2017|178|Thank you friend and that is actually a great idea I was hesitant initially to try cloth pads because I was afraid that the blood would just spill over the sides but I m running out of options so I should definitely try Thank you so much for the tip That s a great idea and thank you for the clarification that some have and some don t have plastic I d definitely go more along the lines of no plastic I d also love to try organic pads if I weren t also allergic to adhesives but thank you so much for the suggestion I m glad to hear that you ve found something that works for you I ll definitely look at r clothpads And that is great news about the ruby cup Thank you so much I ll also give that a try Omg bless the shit out of your lovely soul TIL and yesterday I learned as well r twoxchromosomes ladies are much better at gynecology than some licensed professionals Lol Thanks again friend 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:56:36 2017|8|That s kinda how I was feeling too 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:56:15 2017|133|Thank you so much for that confirmation I also felt like it was unethical I m struggling with it because I know she cared and was trying to help but she was so hurtful and aggressive with her opinion I don t want her to get into trouble I only just want her to change her approach I m sure that she has a lot of knowledge on the technical parts of her job so I really want her to use that rather than her shitty judgemental advice you know What is the college of physicians I m sorry I definitely want to follow your advice on this but I don t know what that is but if you can tell me I ll do my best thank you again for the help 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:51:42 2017|64|Man bless your soul 3 I ll definitely try that That allergy sounds like hell though oh man I m so sorry And good idea I ve been hesitant to try reusable cloth pads cause I m afraid the blood will just spill over the sides but I m definitely running out of options so I ll 100 give that a try Thanks lovely 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:49:23 2017|37|Diva cup I also have trouble with silicone but my doctor said it was probably the traces of latex I m not sure I have trouble getting a straight answer when it comes to my reproductive shit 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 14:47:41 2017|55|Right Like I don t want to wait years I have pain now Like exactly Some things you can t wait on to test I appreciate her being cautious but again she was being incredibly condescending and insensitive in other areas so there wasn t much point to her being cautious in only 1 area 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:23:19 2017|38|Omg GIRL you are making my day The comment section aside from the few assholes is actually so blessed and sweet also I LOVE your use of the phrase pile of quivering goo THANK YOU YOU TOO LOVELY 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:18:29 2017|143|I could say the same about you and that s amazing you should totally do it You d be great at it and you would never do the things the bad doctors do so I d say go for it You can be everything in a doctor that the bad doctors aren t And thanks girl yeah it s a definite annoyance I was on the pill for a good while but my body rejects it I got all the negative side effects of every one I ve tried thank you so much for the advice though Omg though endo sucks my mama used to have it I ve heard it s awful I m so glad that the pill has helped you though Yay thank you for the heads up omg wishing you the best too Hope you kick endo s ass 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:13:09 2017|22|I think that s the one I tried if it is it only accepts American doctor reviews But I ll check again 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:10:22 2017|51|Oh yeah cause no one has their lapse days when they feel like shit What s with your unnecessary vendetta against me I ve done nothing to you aside from rightfully telling you to fuck off Which I would like to bring forth again Thanks for all the name calling though 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:01:41 2017|6|Oh you again Fuck off please 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 02:00:53 2017|244|Thank you I m white but good thought That s really shitty to hear that doctors treat you differently automatically based on race that s dumb and completely fucked up girl That sounds like an amazing class actually Good luck in it I bet it s really interesting disturbing And ex actly You get it Thanks so much you too I hope you stop being profiled based on race that s complete fucking bullshit for them to do to anyone And thank you for the tip I m actually also allergic to the adhesive bandages are always fun too so I ve pretty much sworn off of pads I tried a cup but I m allergic to the traces of latex in them so I also get a rash with those god doesn t want me to be able to deal with my period evidently period panties also give me a rash because they dig into my skin but I ll try a different style size and hope for the best I ve found some solace in organic tampons but the applicators are super tricky and I end up only being able to get them in 50 of the time and then I can only use them for an hour or so before they start to hurt So for the time being that is my best option but I won t necessarily be able to afford them forever since they re far more expensive 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov  3 01:45:15 2017|50|Yes exactly I don t wanna make her life harder just her other patients lives easier And exactly I just want it to be brought to light so that she knows that she fucked with me and probably multiple other patients So she changes her way of going about things

TwoXChromosomes|Thu Nov  2 20:59:06 2017|58|Good idea Thank you I m definitely going to do this Another comment suggested a google review which I also liked the idea of but I couldn t figure out how to do it anonymously and I don t want my face to be attached to such sensitive info if that makes sense I ll definitely call though
