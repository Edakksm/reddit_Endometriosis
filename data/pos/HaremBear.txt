AskWomen|Sun Dec 24 22:49:51 2017|73|Both these things were so helpful when I needed closure after a bad breakup I would make the same 2 lists almost every day 1 why he sucked and wasn t right for me and 2 what I wanted in the perfect SO Then spent a lot of time listening to my feel better playlist There was a lot of crying but I eventually got through it and am better off for it 
AskWomen|Sun Dec 24 10:04:40 2017|135|I had just gone through a terrible breakup and didn t want a new commitment I started sleeping with a friend of a friend We both knew it was an FWB thing and set out ground rules like no staying the night It was fantastic at first just a lot of fun Then we started breaking the rules We would fall asleep and stay over we were doing it multiple times a night and the in between became very date like After about a month it became clear we needed to end it or just start dating He asked me out and we decided to stop having sex to make sure we actually liked each other outside the bedroom Turns out we re pretty into each other we ve been married 3 years this month 
AskWomen|Wed Dec 20 16:50:10 2017|52|I expected to get cold feet at some point but never did I had no doubts at all The wedding itself was a huge source of stress for me but the marriage never was We re celebrating our third anniversary tomorrow and I m just as sure today as I was then 
AskWomen|Tue Dec 19 16:21:42 2017|58|Don t assume someone will change If your partner doesn t want kids and you do don t assume they ll change their mind This goes for anything about them Early on it might feel worth it to overlook that issue but the breakup is just going to hurt more later when you ve invested into the relationship 
AskWomen|Fri Dec 15 04:58:16 2017|96|I used to hate my small boobs so much and got made fun of a lot for them when I was younger But I love them now I get to wear these super cute and Lacey bralettes that my friends can t get away with because they don t have enough support Sometimes I just don t wear a bra at all or just pasties which is so much more comfortable and allows for all sorts of shirt dress styles that don t work with bras Plus I can wear button down shirts without any pulling 
AskWomen|Tue Dec 12 12:54:42 2017|38|I agree with a lot of other comments but wanted to add something less emotional My husband recently got me an ivibe and it has been amazing I won t go into details but you should Google it 
AskWomen|Tue Dec 12 07:39:29 2017|36|BC is the worst I ve always had bad reactions to it but the fear of getting pregnant was always unbearable And of course it s bear impossible finding a doctor willing to sterilize a woman 
AskWomen|Tue Dec 12 07:36:11 2017|70|I m infertile because of a medical condition that is requiring a hysterectomy Which sucks I m not looking forward to surgery next week But it s also nice because that means no more periods either Adenomyosis sucks but if it had to happen to anyone I m glad it s me My best friend wants children so badly and it would kill me if she was going through this 
AskWomen|Mon Dec 11 23:15:48 2017|102|Same I always knew I didn t want them but there was that little voice telling me I should have them It s so ingrained in women that you re selfish or wrong if you don t want children I didn t fully accept it as a valid choice until my mid 20s around the time I graduated from college But I knew 100 that I had truly accepted it when I found out I m infertile about a month ago and my only reaction was relief and mild irritation that I ve wasted so much money and stress over birth control 
AskWomen|Mon Dec 11 23:05:56 2017|50|Remind yourself the procedure isn t worse than whatever medical issue you re going through Needles and surgery aren t fun but neither is being really sick And I agree with a lot of the other posts don t look at the needle Look away and keep the conversation going 
AskWomen|Sat Dec  9 17:01:28 2017|263|I used to cry every time I left his house and didn t know why As soon as I got in my car it was like I couldn t hold it in anymore Friends ex used to make her take photos in weird poses or of weird things to prove she was where she said she would be For example he d give her 1 minute to send a photo of her with a peace sign in front of her mom s stove Blowing up on you for not answering a text or call immediately Rarely seeing your friends and either only hanging out with theirs or only with each other Isolation is no joke it s like joining a cult Not leaving you alone when you have a girls night A text or two is fine but when they re constantly checking in and asking who you re with that s too much Being shut down anytime you try to talk to someone new Knew someone who s ex would always befriend every girl he talked to no matter where he met them If that didn t work she would tell him the girl was rude to her or that the girl had confided in her that he made the girl uncomfortable so he would stop talking to her Literally blocking the door when you try to leave Reading your texts emails social media or requiring to know the password for them I m sure there are more but these are the most obvious ones I ve seen myself or through friends 
AskWomen|Fri Dec  8 08:23:35 2017|34|Ticket to Ride is one of my favorites There s an app version too that my husband and I play on the go if we re waiting in line or for an appointment somewhere 
AskWomen|Fri Dec  8 08:21:53 2017|43|If you re willing to spend the money Mansions of Madness is really fun with 2 5 players It s a Lovecraft style game and an app on a tablet or laptop controls the monsters and puzzles so you play cooperatively to survive 
AskWomen|Mon Dec  4 16:42:35 2017|41|That dating is totally different as an adult Just because things aren t working out now doesn t mean you aren t worthy of love or that you won t find it someday Don t settle just because you re lonely 
AskWomen|Mon Dec  4 07:16:16 2017|52|My husband and all my friends SOs do this Watching YouTube videos on his phone at full volume No matter what we re doing We could be watching a movie and suddenly his phone is blasting something and he acts like I m rude for telling him to turn the sound off 
AskWomen|Mon Dec  4 06:00:16 2017|120|I ve never heard of aci jel but I ll definitely look it up I m really looking forward to not having to curl up on the bathroom floor anymore Thank you for sharing I ve had problems with my period since I was 14 and Endo and cysts we re thrown around a lot but I couldn t convince a doctor to actually take it seriously until a few months ago 13 years later When I called my mom to tell her she apologized for not believing me because every doctor said I was healthy The relief of knowing it s not all in my head and never has been is the only thing keeping me going right now
