relationships|Mon Nov 20 13:00:45 2017|60|On my initial read I was thinking this is exactly how my SO could cheat on me I m guaranteed out of the apartment by 7pm week nights because I work graveyard and we only really spend weekends together and about 30mins overlap on my working days After one date though I wouldn t even bother if I were OP 
relationships|Sun Sep 24 15:33:34 2017|114|This is a super great post and I really appreciate it Only thing is at the start we were both adults he was 26 I was 20 or so It s a sink cost fallacy thing at the moment in my head Which is why I m wavering I saw him briefly earlier and explained pretty much what you said that he s changing and that s nice but he didn t bother even though he knew it was a big deal for the 7 prior years I m going to stay away for just now re evaluate what I think the best choice is and I might consider showing him your post Thanks 
relationships|Sun Sep 24 15:27:31 2017|38|No apologies necessary It s just cathartic to know other people are dealing with the same things I just wish I d made more of a stink about stuff when I was 3 years in and not 7 
relationships|Sun Sep 24 00:02:49 2017|45|That s actually a pretty good idea I m all for other people writing down their problems then I never do it myself I ll fish out and dedicate a notebook now since I ve nothing else to do but sit and stare into space 
relationships|Sun Sep 24 00:01:25 2017|35|That s kind of the exact opposite response from what I was expecting You might be right I don t know Another poster also suggested giving it more time and logging my feelings so maybe 
relationships|Sat Sep 23 22:56:01 2017|98|Yeah I pretty much said I couldn t believe he would change any more because people don t That we d be back to no sex and him watching an obscene amount of YouTube in no time He said a month wasn t long enough to establish that the change he s made so far will stick And I agree there hasn t been enough time but I probably know the outcome anyway so why delay it I thought about counselling but he s day and I m night we d never have the time to do it

relationships|Wed Aug 30 13:08:58 2017|21|I m not the OP but am in a similar situation and holy fuck I needed to read this Thank you
