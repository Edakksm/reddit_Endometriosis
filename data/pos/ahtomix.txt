AskWomen|Sun Oct 15 10:11:19 2017|83|That s one thing we love about our relationship Because we are different we always have something to talk about and teach the other Like I hate movies but damn he got me into Bladerunner and he doesn t like my favorite band but I got him obsessed with one of their songs And at the very least we can appreciate how much the other loves something I wouldn t want someone just like me They make good friends but not good partners 
AskWomen|Sun Oct 15 04:23:23 2017|41|We talk about his hobbies my hobbies his interests his day my day etc we talk about everything Just because I personally am not interested in something doesn t mean I am not interested in hearing what he has to say 
AskWomen|Sat Oct 14 20:37:16 2017|160|He is more interested in the idea of the perfect girl than the girl herself Like he wants a girl who loves his favorite band too who likes the same music and movies who fits into his scene On the surface that doesn t sound too bad It s not wrong to want someone to share your interests But he is so focused on those qualities that it comes across as he wants those qualities only and won t compromise for anyone different As if those qualities are what defines this girl No girl will ever live up to the imaginary girl he has dreamed up I ve tried explaining it to him Don t look for a girl who loves your favorite band Look for the girl who loves how much you love your favorite band My husband and I have vastly different interests but we still enjoy our time together and love each other for who we are 
AskWomen|Sat Oct  7 23:38:52 2017|114|We have very different interests He likes movies and music and technology and physics I hate movies and am weird about music I love art and books and writing and medicine I love being outside There s more differences than that but the point is we always have something to talk about Because of our differences we can offer perspectives that the other people in our lives can t We can share interests that we normally would never find I don t really care for his favorite band but god damn I love that he loves it Although I feel pretty proud that I got him interested in my favorite band s new song

AskWomen|Sat Sep  9 15:34:33 2017|142|It was weird We met on OkCupid for basically just a hookup situation There was a strong physical attraction and we both wanted to keep sleeping together I was kind of awful to him because I thought he was a fuckboy who just wanted sex so I kept myself from getting close to him until I realized he wanted more than just sex At that point I had hurt him emotionally enough that he distanced himself from me and I kept trying to get him back Eventually we said fuck it started dating and have been madly in love ever since Thinking back it scares me how I treated him and pushed him away because I was scared emotionally damaged from my past because I could have prevented our life together from happening and this is the happiest I ve ever been

AskWomen|Thu Jul  6 20:56:10 2017|203|This question made me realize after all these years I still am not sure how i got into that mess We sparked immediately I had a lot of emotional issues due to deep self loathing He was funny and charismatic and beautiful and there was no way a guy like him could be into me But he genuinely seemed to care about me I invested my life into him I think the biggest sign now is how much he enjoyed the fact that I needed him He saw me as something broken that he could fix I was dying to be fixed And that was his way in Of course there was a huge list of abusive behaviors and tactics that he used against me but that s what it comes down to I was broken and he wanted to fix me Now I am happily married and my husband doesn t see me as broken Instead of trying to fix me he inspires me to change myself for the better And that is a big difference My advice Know that you are not broken s he will not fix you and a good partner will inspire you to change for the better 
AskWomen|Sat Jul  1 16:12:53 2017|214|I just texted my husband this yesterday You know what I was thinking about on the way to work One of the things I love about you is that you relax me and keep me in check When I get all stressed about my job and money you remind me that it will be okay and I keep repeating what you said don t let this turn into previous job where I was miserable and I just really appreciate you keeping me in check You let me feel my emotions but you don t let me allow them to consume me I have anxiety and am bipolar I overstress way too easily He will talk to me when I am having problems but if I start wallowing in them and hosting my own pity party he tells me to use my Spock brain and start thinking of logical ways to fix whatever is causing my problems Of course there is a lot I love about him but lately this has been what I have appreciated the most I ve had a rough week at work and he has been reminding me of what I wanted this job and all the good things about me and helping me see things from a more realistic POV
