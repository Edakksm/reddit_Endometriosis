AskWomen|Thu Oct 19 11:30:41 2017|140|We all have insecurities somewhere I think But what defines you is how you deal with it We can always be better Do better But if you re constantly making excuses for not being better I don t want a part of it If I m doing something that makes you feel insecure tell me and I ll fix it It s really that simple But if I m not and you re just deeply insecure with who you are then only you can fix it Also not a fan of being treated a certain way because other people have wronged you It s an assumption that I m just like said people It s okay to be cautious but if you pull me close just to not let me in due to those insecurities I can t do it
