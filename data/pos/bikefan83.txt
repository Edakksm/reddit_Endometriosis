relationships|Fri Aug  4 17:53:25 2017|130|Very good points thanks I did search the sub like you suggested and it was kind of sobering reading I think I wouldn t be in this mess if I d realised he was married from the beginning You re right about the emotional intimacy and so on and that was beginning when I thought he was single I ve managed to shuffle some things at work so I shouldn t see him for 3 weeks I think I need to try to think of him as a different person when he s back and almost pretend I never knew all this stuff he told me I never asked him anything about his marriage but maybe I need to be blunt that I don t want to hear anything more
relationships|Fri Aug  4 17:46:56 2017|140|Yeah I have been trying to tell myself this and know that logically you are right but for some reason on some level my brain is thinking it d be different with me I also think he s a bit messed up from her cheating and doesn t know what he wants I think the best thing for him if they do end their marriage would probably be to spend time alone for a while and work out who he is and what he wants Not jump from one thing to another Honestly it s like something s gone haywire in my brain I have met people before been attracted to them and then found out they were taken and every time before the attraction has just gone straight away upon finding that out This is just a total mess 
relationships|Fri Aug  4 17:38:35 2017|71|Thanks do you think I should tell him why I m backing away and restricting things to being professional Or just do it and expect that it should be obvious I wanted to say that I think we need to stop all this as it might be heading in a bad direction but I m worried that even talking about that direction is going to get us further along the path 
relationships|Fri Aug  4 17:35:12 2017|55|Thanks good point I ve thought about it and realised maybe it s all a symptom of being a bit lonely and that really I should try dating again I think this weekend I m going to reactivate my online dating profile and remind myself that there s plenty of eligible single guys out there 
relationships|Fri Aug  4 17:25:22 2017|99|Thanks I should have put in the original post that one of the many reasons why I don t want to have an affair is what it would do to the kids and that has weighed on my mind a lot I lost my father when I was young and so the thought of affecting a child s relationship with their dad is pretty upsetting I don t want to be thinking about this stuff it s like weird intrusive thoughts that I don t want and they re all the type of thoughts I ve never had before
