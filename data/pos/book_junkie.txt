relationships|Sat Dec 30 14:10:11 2017|166|I have to say my first thought was also ADHD Especially since he cannot see it OP I have been in this situation and it did not end well I tried and tried to tell him that I didn t want to have sex with someone who I had to clean up after I was so exhausted from doing everything myself that he was really just one more chore Sure I do every fucking thing then fuck you too You have spent a lot of time already trying to get him to understand what he is doing That isn t working and likely never will So it is now the time when you need to make a decision He isn t going to change You either need to stay and find a way for yourself to gain some sanity in the situation by changing how you view it or you need to decide that it isn t worth it anymore Either way good luck to you
