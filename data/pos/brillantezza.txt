relationships|Sat May 13 11:57:19 2017|65|Well you maybe can t But some people can some people care a lot about having a partner who is a companion who they can be intellectually equal to and have similar interests In the same regard I know many successful couples who almost nothing intellectually in common It s almost as though different people value different things in a partner and that s okay
