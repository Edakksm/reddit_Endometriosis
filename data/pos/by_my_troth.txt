TwoXChromosomes|Sat Mar 17 12:39:23 2018|72|If you are looking at laproscopy for endometriosis please find a doctor that specializes in that surgery I had mine done by a gynecologist and though she was a great obgyn she left a lot of the endometriosis in there due to location or size I highly recommend the Endometriosis Research Center Facebook page if you want to educate yourself on the treatments for Endometriosis I have learned so much from them
