TwoXChromosomes|Wed Nov  1 18:23:00 2017|54|I prefer my husband who I courted in the traditional way I asked out a long time friend But if you enjoy hitting on random women with no other info but their superficial appearance you d certainly have better odds with a dating app than preying on unsuspecting women at work or running errands

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Sep 15 15:53:03 2017|231| I don t understand men who have a sex drive so strong it becomes this primal predatory urge that overrides their good sense and judgement It isn t their sex drive It s their sense of entitlement Some have been brainwashed by PUA and TRP to believe that women are within their domain But most simply can t fathom the idea that the unwanted and unsolicited attention they are paying to women isn t a favor Isn t flattering Is aggravating and startling They can t see outside themselves long enough to grok that being put on the spot far from a safe or comfortable zone is an imposition I mean I don t get it either Outside of a hook up friendly venue like a bar or party I d never consider approaching a man who I didn t know a few things about Whether or not we have something in common something to talk about Whether we have similar goals And I d prefer at least some indication that he finds me attractive and interesting too But don t feel as though you are an outsider because you have manners and common sense When you find that appealing woman clutching a PS4 make friends fast and see if you share any chemistry Relationships aren t nearly as complicated as some of these misguided assholes make them out to be 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Sep 15 15:23:43 2017|193|Alright I ll bite Your first site is clilckbait tabloid crap 2nd cite is a shitty poem 3rd cite is written by a male pick up artist for men to read 4th cite is Manrepeller com 5th cite Why play hard to get is terrible advice 6th cite claims that men are masochists and love being told no This true for you You a masochist a glutton for rejection 7th cite is written by a woman who zero credentials or qualifications who claims to understand that men are wired to take rejection as evidence that a woman is chaste and picky 8th cite says don t play hard to get 9th cite says Don t Play Hard to Get 10th cite is an advertisement So exactly two of your ten cites claim that men enjoy pursuing hard to get women and both of those cites are paid for clicks 7 of the ten cites you linked advise against playing games a guy simply asks for a phone number people on here act like she s being physically assaulted Here LMGTFY Don t ask women for phone numbers outside of social venues Easy peasy 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Sep 15 14:47:37 2017|112| Maybe it s unfair for me to say this but like clubs parties festivals actual dating websites are there at your disposal if you want to pick up strange women Nothing unfair about this at all it s common sense Unfortunately they will counter with we can t compete with the good looking men at those places and a couple nameless subs advise us to stake out grocery stores and parks to prey on women where there is less competition with high value men Most of them feel that their need for female validation is more important than whatever we are doing Those men can t be reached with reason and logic 
TwoXChromosomes|Fri Sep 15 14:32:17 2017|190|My point is you aren t using facts and you admit you can t even cite your claims Your own words contradict your claims that women are taught to play hard to get u Sydrek says What s next should she had used her rape whistle and shouted ASSAULT ASSAULT because he got out of his car So which is it Women are taught lead men on or they are being currently taught to be hyperdefensive and be prepared to physically assault men before they approach What are women being taught these days Pick a side and stick to it At this point you are arguing against yourself The prevailing message for women since the early 80s has been safety and agency You won t find a modern magazine blog or online zine which promotes misleading men or playing hard to get No business entity would even risk that kind of liability You are attempting to blame women for your unwillingness to accept no for an answer and attempting to blame society for your wrong headed belief that women expect you to hit on them in inappropriate venues and times

TwoXChromosomes|Fri Sep 15 13:09:18 2017|485| typical placing onus on men The onus is on the person who is actively pursuing a romantic relationship regardless of gender The OP s girlfriend was waiting for a bus The only onus on her was to get a ride somewhere You collective you took it upon yourself to choose an inappropriate time and place to force a romantic overture on a stranger who really can t escape because she needs to catch a bus You aren t required by nature nurture society or evolution to pursue strange women at bus stops woman generally do play hard to get At the bus stop Dude she was just waiting for a ride not sending out hidden signals to strange men to hit on her dating tips for woman play hard to get Haven t seen anything like that in 50 or more years See plenty of tips on how not to get raped or roofied how and where to safely connect with strangers for a hook up or blind date How to enjoy casual sex without getting kidnapped or murdered I mean you don t have to buy Cosmo to see this you can just swing by TwoX and see what women talk about re relationships We are not encouraging one another to send mixed signals to play hard to get or fuck around with men s minds and hearts That s not only a crazy accusation you are making there it s pretty fucking offensive That range from always say no the first time to the don t answer his text back immediately Same advice for men and women don t blow up their phone or your come across as clingy and needy That s not playing hard to get that s just good advice on not making a nuisance of yourself early in a relationship I don t expect everyone here to agree on taking part of their respectability in how we shaped society There is no society dictating our individual behavior How and what you do in day to day interactions is entirely up to you Any man can proposition a woman at a bus stop and it s pretty much always going to be awkward to scary for her That s not a bar not a party and you are an unpredictable stranger not a friend of a friend or even a casual acquaintance It s pretty close to what it feels like for you to have a larger than you homeless man corner you and demand a handout You will likely feel put out imposed on Maybe uncomfortable or even frightened And if and when you refuse you don t know if that homeless man is going to freak out on you and yell spit or call you names Is there where you tell me that the onus is on aggressive homeless men is to approach strangers and demand a handout
