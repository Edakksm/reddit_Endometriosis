relationships|Wed Nov 22 13:32:21 2017|37|Tell em to come back after they re legal and graduated and in the meantime they can practice getting to know someone on a diplomatic professional level that doesn t include romance and you enforce those boundaries 
relationships|Fri Nov  3 18:40:33 2017|70|How i handle such conversations at work is to say I m not really interested in anyone s opinion on someone else s appearance or the specific kind of sex they have it makes me sound like a prudish bitch when i have to enforce those boundaries but i stoneface my way through it I ve also had years and years of retail wage slavery to practice stonefacing too though 
relationships|Sat Oct 28 04:33:17 2017|165|It s a good thing that he was so upset about his outburst it means that he s aware of his behavior Someone who is a crappy father or partner would be finding ways to blame you or the baby for getting him so worked up And we hear about plenty of dads on here who are lucky lazy enough to be able to sleep through the squalling crying while Mom is the one feeling beserk with sleep deprivation and while it is true that moms are extra attuned to the sound it s wonderful that he wants to help instead of rolling over to ignore By the way OP if it is reflux you could see about getting a rocker that has the baby sleep tilted up at an angle That s the only way I ve been able to deal with my reflux when i was a baby decades and decades ago my father used to sleep in a chair holding me upright 
relationships|Fri Oct 27 18:17:21 2017|28|Exactly this kind of speaking up acting is the first and easiest thing that dudes can do to help with the constant undercurrent of misogny in our society
relationships|Thu Oct 26 20:25:20 2017|336|If it s you taking care of everything house and chore wise and when it s also his messes that you re cleaning up his laundry that you re doing for him his food that you cook for him it kind of gets all mashed together into I m basically acting as a mother to this additional man child who just keeps pestering me and grabbing at me and it s the absolutely least attractive thing in the world to have to add his sexual needs on top of the household needs and food needs as one more thing on Mom s plate to do People often recommend that the husband in this situation needs to have some empathy about the fact that the wife wants to be feel taken care of too but when there s piles of laundry and grocery shopping and menus and so many obligations to take care of at the back of her mind that it s more aggravating than attractive for the husband to just blunder in and demonstrate his love for you via demanding grabbing sexual attention It s not so much a quid pro quo of do the dishes or some laundry and you get a sex token than it is a we are both adult partners here to help each other through our daily lives and when Dad rolls up his sleeves and does stuff like cleaning or cooking or a couple hours of childcare as an equal contributing partner in the household it frees mom up to be able to relax and find herself again after so much effort being put into her identity as mom and servent to messy housemates I m probably phrasing it badly but you can look this up online because it s a very common thing Dude doesn t understand that you re touched out and caretaker d out and that him grabbing at you is just one more demand that you have to feel guilty about not jumping to fulfill 
relationships|Thu Oct 26 20:05:48 2017|4|Have them watch gattaca
relationships|Thu Oct 26 06:21:08 2017|48|I d pull out my years of retail wage slavery give a great big happy grin and say wow ruuuude People react to your facial expressions before the words process and the dissonance can be so entertaining when they don t get the reaction they were banking on 
relationships|Wed Oct 25 09:13:58 2017|30| literally abandoned really By adopting her in family Instead of dropping her in a basket at the fire station or local church or a fucking dumpster Jesus way to overstate
relationships|Tue Oct 24 16:08:16 2017|44| Because everything in society even nowadays reinforces the attractive more valuable as a person paradigm and she s smart enough to know on some level that this value was assigned to something she did nothing to acquire and will eventually be lost with age 
relationships|Tue Oct 24 16:03:23 2017|62|Well there is the one bit about if a man rapes a girl the punishment is marriage to the victim since she s now unsuitable for marriage But really it s more of a the courses of action taken by the various Christian powers that be when confronted with verifiable sexual abuse among their own ranks rather than any one specific doctrine
relationships|Fri Oct 20 15:00:11 2017|46|I m guessing that you re not reading what I m saying here I never said that this was a one way easy ticket to him getting immediately fired All I m saying is that it isn t a he said she said wishy washy situation 
relationships|Fri Oct 20 14:03:38 2017|54|When he apologized for his inappropriateness in fucking writing I m not saying that it won t be hard to get him out of a position of authority over subordinates and students with this single incident I m just saying that it s not in any way a matter of he said she said 
relationships|Fri Oct 20 11:00:25 2017|57|It s hardly a he said she said situation when he put it in fucking writing not to mention the implicit threat in mentioning the recommendation letters It s fine to outline the worst case scenario of him getting a sleep on the wrist but for you to pretend that it s this foregone conclusion is bullshit 
relationships|Mon Oct 16 22:51:07 2017|84|You re putting your business on the internet for the general public to help you untangle this mess feedback is part and parcel of it It on you to acknowledge how you ve gone wrong thus far in not reinforcing your boundaries so that you can learn from it and act differently in the future Or you can get overly defensive with the strangers on the internet instead of figuring out how to be constructively assertive about your son with your parents Your choice 
relationships|Mon Oct 16 22:30:30 2017|70|Sorry no that was something you made up entirely so that you had an excuse to be mad at them instead of addressing what they had to say about your parenting and how this has become a less than ideal situation Good luck on reestablishing boundaries with stepdad you might be better served spending your efforts preparing for that confrontation instead of getting all pissy about this requested online feedback
relationships|Mon Oct 16 22:06:03 2017|25|And no one implied that they were a perfect parent simply because they had criticism to offer you were the one overreacting by saying that
relationships|Mon Oct 16 20:28:09 2017|41|Overreacting and pretending that this person is a perfect parent just because they have something to say that you don t want to hear is the kind of bullshit that someone would be coming here for advice on how to handle 
relationships|Sat Sep 30 06:25:44 2017|16|Ugh god the one boyfriend who tried to physically push chicken into his girlfriend s mouth
relationships|Tue Sep 26 09:26:22 2017|28| PS votes will be apportioned in accordance to the overall percentage of rent paid ie OP pays 3 4ths of rent OP gets 3 votes to her 1 
relationships|Thu Sep 21 10:34:08 2017|17|Or she calls the office in a panic and ends up getting OP a lockout charge anyways
relationships|Mon Sep 18 09:11:20 2017|15|Ew way to judge a whole culture based on one post and a half google
relationships|Mon Sep 18 09:07:15 2017|38|Right Every Hmong community i know is an entire community who ve been having kids the last 40 years there s got to be at least a little cross cultural pollination somewhere that she can reach out to
relationships|Fri Sep  8 22:25:15 2017|18|That s why women can identify something like three times as many different shades of colors as men
relationships|Fri Sep  1 17:06:07 2017|24|And also demonstrating to your daughter how to establish boundaries and enforce them if only by example when this comes up in the future
relationships|Sat Aug 26 10:09:03 2017|21|Brother wants to travel with her shudder and he s been on Mom s case to convince OP on his behalf
relationships|Fri Aug 18 18:33:18 2017|22|The employer should know that applying different standards of hairstyles for different genders is discriminatory not dependant on OP s individual situation
relationships|Mon Aug  7 18:39:48 2017|19|But also being not supportive of someone because they re not straight is a little more than just politics 
relationships|Sun Aug  6 11:38:50 2017|20|That 30k would be better placed in a fund that pays out 1k living expenses monthly for 2 5 years
relationships|Sat Aug  5 08:18:05 2017|23|In the context of work she speaks formally with the clients In the context of asking reddit about text messages she uses contractions 
relationships|Thu Aug  3 22:52:00 2017|6| Media created written produced by women 
relationships|Wed Aug  2 13:32:58 2017|151|I agree that would fall under gossip and I d just refuse to engage both in and out of work He probably should have mentioned something maybe at minimum as they were preparing for the trip so as to warn her but if your default mode is keep your head down your mouth shut about things that don t involve you and your nose to the grindstone i could see how it might not have occurred to him to gossip with his wife about the personal scandals at work Jobs don t just fall out of job trees so he thought it was worth it to keep out of his co workers personal lives He might have said something when he rebuffed the advances but maybe he knows that his wife would have flipped and insisted on his quitting once she knew about that even after he had already handled it 
relationships|Fri Jul 28 17:27:03 2017|47|Honestly that would be something that I d make a preemptive public Facebook post clarifying that the show punched up the editing to show something that didn t exist and that OP is perfectly happily married so he hopes no one takes the wrong idea from it
relationships|Thu Jul 27 15:49:42 2017|30|Yeah but is she like in the outback with zero cell reception She s not on Facebook didn t leave emergency contact info about where she s staying or anything 
relationships|Sun Jul 23 23:44:12 2017|49|Nah chart that shit so that you can point to it Make it a lighthearted joke out in the open that you need to add this to the log so that he s aware that you re not buying his mealy mouthed excuses that it s all just coincidences 
relationships|Sun Jul 23 23:18:43 2017|101|I like to say oh wow more commentary on my appearance gosh it just never ends kind of like you re breaking the fourth wall to an audience that knows what you re going through Even if there s no one else paying attention to you two It lets her know that yeah you heard her and you re letting it brush right off your shoulders If i want to get extra snide when they pursue I ll say thanks for the feedback I ll give it the attention it deserves but that s verging on too assertive shit stirring sometimes 
relationships|Wed Jul 19 08:38:47 2017|64|Nah she s been in constant daily contact with various high level men in her organization every single day and instead of nurturing her career in any way they ve been treating her like every other soccer mom type secretary there i think that the specific advice about seeking out other women in positions where she d like to advance is much more constructive 
relationships|Wed Jul 19 08:26:06 2017|99|She would benefit from a perspective of another woman in the industry no one is saying all men are like this it s just obvious that this specific office isn t going to allow her the opportunity to progress instead every idea she comes up with will get co opted and others will take the credit I don t understand why you think talking to another women or a few is such a useless idea to just dismiss out of hand doesn t seem like you re a woman so maybe you have no idea what it s like 
relationships|Wed Jul 19 08:10:33 2017|67|Okay she caught feelings the appropriate way to handle the feelings would have been too sit down with him in a nonsexual setting alone and discussed how to proceed given her caught feelings Not pseudo pressure him into a semi public date then start crying and telling complete strangers his neighbors that he s such a horrible person for maintaining the relationship that they both agreed to 
relationships|Sun Jul 16 00:08:30 2017|45|But how to the daily chores of maintaining the household split up Someone s got to cook clean shop organize mail and bills These are all ways that he could easily contribute to demonstrate his commitment to the relationship without ponying up cash right now 
relationships|Sun Jul 16 00:04:42 2017|53|He could contribute to the rest of the labor of the household like cooking cleaning logistics of bills and keeping the household stocked He had neglected to even make an effort to the end She s being honest about his skill level in terms of crafting furniture I m inclined to believe her 
relationships|Thu Jul  6 01:16:24 2017|37|Something tells me that the two whole times he s cleaned the house by himself we re probably the first time he s even been aware of the existence of house cleaning as it relates to him
relationships|Sat Jul  1 15:55:00 2017|80|That s not even including the logistics of stopping every hour to care for dog Or the wear and tear on OP s car not to mention if he s even allowed to be driving her car according to insurance policies How much would it cost to pay a dogsitter to escort the dog to vacation via uber Cause that s more realistic about the compensation deserved for a task like this and how much she s undervaluing her request
relationships|Fri Jun 23 08:36:08 2017|19|Uhhh it belonged to his mom first and he inherited it i highly doubt that he built the cabin
relationships|Fri Jun 16 19:24:12 2017|40|Yeah talk about how she won t be able to introduce her friends to him because he ll creep on the girls and weird out the dudes and it ll be a real damper on her classmates opinion of her
relationships|Fri Jun 16 19:21:06 2017|60|I d be talking to her directly about how she ll be that weird girl at college with a 30 year old boyfriend even if it s just mentioning in a roundabout lightly making fun of it way because i imagine that the opinions of her peers will count for much more in her brain awash with hormones and rebellion 
relationships|Fri Jun 16 01:18:52 2017|55|Exactly even OP s planning on skipping out on his family for multiple days and leaving the care of a 3 month infant all on Mom i wonder how many weekends he has or would be willing able to handle baby 100 of the time for two three days while Mom slips out to decompress
relationships|Fri Jun 16 01:12:30 2017|104|I guess we ll see exactly how hard you actually attempt to leave your trip early to celebrate father s day or if you just don t happen to get around packing up and leaving on time and the time runs away with itself and oh look it s way too late to do the thing now oh well Also this trip is so close by that you can cut it short by like a third and be back home so fast That s just extra reason to do the fishing another weekend if it s so little hassle to pop back and forth
relationships|Tue Jun 13 13:57:06 2017|31|Yeah i don t see him offering to help clean an area where he obviously feels entitled to hangout in order to get this cleaning done faster or anything forget him
