relationships|Tue Mar  6 16:46:41 2018|314|Do I want kids It s a slightly complicated question I have fertility issues I might be able to conceive with medical intervention but it s a big question mark and could take months or years of trying Between that and all of the instability I ve experienced over the past few years conditions would have to be pretty ideal for me to feel safe enough to take on the responsibility of having or adopting a small human I m not ruling it out totally and sometimes I get that little twinge of wanting to but the idea makes me nervous no matter who my partner is We have talked about the possibility of children more than once and he would like to have a child in the future I think he would be an excellent co parent as long as he s in a position where he s not traveling constantly I told him that if we decide to go down that road I will only consider it if he finds stable employment without frequent travel He agreed with me on that and that he will seek something immediately in the unlikely chance I become accidentally pregnant As far as how I feel about how he s handling this difficult period in our relationship that s why I m here looking for advice on how to talk to him about it He knows I m struggling but I ve tried really hard to not stress him out about it Last year when the busy travel season started it was hard but the relationship was new and I was already used to being alone a lot He s been mostly home for the past few months and we definitely grew a lot closer I m not dealing as well with his absence now that my feelings for him have increased into something more serious

relationships|Tue Mar  6 15:09:16 2018|312|You are definitely right about it being two separate but related issues I did work out sort of a budget There isn t a lot we can do to downgrade our lifestyle any further I don t make much and he makes a lot less He has one money wasting thing we can change he has listed his motorcycle for sale which he purchased before we met and he was in a different living situation where he could afford it If that sells it will be a big help I can t think of a side gig he could realistically take on while he s gone almost constantly and on call to leave at any time I ve been resisting it because I need work life balance but I am working on getting my own side business back up and going Along with my other work I m a silversmith and used to do art shows full time It s the only way I can think of to be able to afford a car It will be at the expense of what very little free time I have which I m not thrilled about but it s something I love doing I used to be in therapy and on meds for my anxiety and PTSD depression whole big list of other things Since making a lot of life changes and getting out of some other stressful situations I ve been able to go off the meds with a pretty good level of success and I m in a much better place than I was mentally It wouldn t hurt to find a new therapist I moved and had an insurance coverage gap I think it s fair to say his work situation would be just as problematic for someone without existing anxiety issues it s just an extra complication with our situation 
relationships|Tue Mar  6 14:51:59 2018|73|I will definitely check out the long distance relationship subs since that definitely is what we have going on a good portion of the time even though we share a home I think it would be a dealbreaker for a lot of folks I hate to make a hasty decision since in the greater scheme of things I think this job is temporary and I hate to give up on him just yet
