relationships|Sat Mar  3 12:32:39 2018|63|That makes more sense to me More like it s not just her money and that you should have a fair say as well Sorry if I came off as rude I think it s just something I m sensitive to because many married men feel it s jlonly their money and that their stay at home spouse doesn t have a say 
relationships|Sat Mar  3 12:30:37 2018|22|Depending on the state what the other commenter is saying is quite true Community property state means everything belongs to both parties 
relationships|Sat Mar  3 11:40:03 2018|17|You re not really addressing the it s not her money issue That s a huge issue 
relationships|Sat Mar  3 02:32:55 2018|188|There are some concrete steps you can take here First of all do not allow her to be snuggly with you You mention she is hand holdy I assume this means you hold hands Do not hold her hand ever This is not a platonic thing to do Second maintain literal and emotional distance from her Coming over to sit on your lap next to you Find a reason to stand up and sit with your girlfriend Do you need to communicate with her Do so in a group text when possible ie when making plans to go to a movie include everyone in one group chat Under no circumstances should you be alone with her or hang out with her one on one even if it is in public That is unless you are interested in pursuing things with this woman It seems like you don t hate the idea of having this kind of relationship with her and that wouldn t make you a bad person by any means this kind of thing happens all the time But you should break up with your girlfriend first 
relationships|Sat Mar  3 01:02:06 2018|25|Unless it s valuable sentimental it s not usually a huge deal especially in the short term You can always get it to her later 
relationships|Sat Mar  3 01:00:20 2018|45|Also fertilizing with human feces is not the same AT ALL as other fertilizers You should never eat anything grown in the soil where he is eliminating The bacteria is very unhealthy for humans You should probably be very careful even when gardening as well 
relationships|Sat Mar  3 00:49:16 2018|112|Dump this weird plant pooper Though the guerilla fertilizing is a very strange habit it s not the real problem This is a clear boundary issue I don t care how much of an environmentalist he is it is common knowledge that pooping in a garden is something that should be cleared with the gardener for goodness sakes at the very minimum it is a health issue He admitted to hiding this from you and then once again he disrespected your boundaries when you got back together though he knew it was a big deal for you Again this was selfish and solely self serving You and your garden deserve better DTMFA 
relationships|Sat Mar  3 00:40:11 2018|8|what in fresh hell is wrong with you
relationships|Fri Mar  2 17:30:38 2018|45|Often girl language is the same as language Here I d bet my bottom dollar she wants some food to get laid and to smoke weed presumably with you If you too are interested in those things it sounds like this is your lucky day 
relationships|Fri Mar  2 16:49:58 2018|90|You don t have to do anything because he wants to do it any more that s one nice thing about a break up He says he wants to stay friends but he gave up the right to have input on your future closeness when he dumped you You don t have to be friends with anyone you don t want to be friends with and this definitely does not sound like someone you want to be friends with Block him and feel better you deserve it Fuck that guy 
relationships|Fri Mar  2 16:39:56 2018|36|You don t think prostitution and sex trafficking go hand in hand You are fooling yourself When it comes to illegal prostitution they don t just go hand in hand they re practically the same hand

relationships|Thu Feb 15 02:22:56 2018|56|I got married last year at 26 the first wedding I attended was my own BUT I definitely knew what they were for has this guy never watched a wedding themed movie or TV show episode What does he think the word fianc means Has he not heard of the term engaged before I am baffled 
relationships|Fri Jan 12 11:45:49 2018|24|Good What he did was a serious crime As an uninvolved party I hope that he get punished for such a disrespectful criminal act 
relationships|Thu Jan 11 10:44:48 2018|22|Right I can t believe OP is standing by while her boyfriend runs over to hopefully see the friend naked Like What 
relationships|Sun Nov  5 17:04:50 2017|14|I think there are a lot of reasons not to trust them as friends 
relationships|Fri Nov  3 19:44:44 2017|55|It is so frustrating My husband had a TBI and some ways I think he was actually really lucky Those with a definite mechanism of injury bike accident get the benefits of care rehab medication etc where those who have sport induced brain injuries are often ignored or brushed away So sorry for your loss 
relationships|Tue Oct 31 02:17:27 2017|48|Great point about breaking things my husband also works with his hands and is very clumsy He breaks things all the time However he absolutely never uses force or strength with me Strong men clumsy men or strong clumsy men aren t all abusers but this guy is

AskWomen|Sun Nov  5 03:57:44 2017|90|This happened to my husband too We foster kittens for a local rescue and once had a litter whose mom was MIA To help them feel better we d spend a great deal of time just chillin in their room Once the hubs took a shirtless nap in there and didn t think much of it Later that night as he was changing he said Man this is weird My nipples are so sore Upon inspection voila many many tiny bite marks on the nips Equal parts aww and eww 
AskWomen|Sat Nov  4 20:24:55 2017|152|Eh to each their own Not saying your version isn t possible just finding someone who you are literally never sick of being around is a very difficult and b maybe not what being emotionally fulfilled looks like for everyone My husband and I always love each other but sometimes I am very annoyed at him In parks and rec they have this cute saying I love you and I like you I don t think the writers meant for us to interpret it this way but we use it as a way to separate LOVE and being annoyed Most of the time I love him and I like him However sometimes I just don t like him But I still love him For instance when he accidentally eats the lunch I packed for work the next day says he ll do laundry but doesn t so I have no clothes etc 
AskWomen|Sat Nov  4 20:17:20 2017|18|And furthermore sometimes being like ugh you are really pissing me off right now is okay too Haha 
AskWomen|Sat Nov  4 14:02:29 2017|24|I mean I think it can also be you re sometimes sick of each other but not all the time At least for me
