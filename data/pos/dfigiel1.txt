relationships|Sat May 19 08:39:40 2018|166|Legitimizing it the way she has been consistently prior to this She s never once said or indicated that these comments bothered her She should apologize He was making what he thought were innocuous comments she never communicated otherwise then verbally assaulted him because she was having a crappy day OP should say I m very sorry for reacting as I did I should have told you earlier the way a grown adult would in my shoes but your consistent commentary about how easy my life is because I don t have children really rubs me the wrong way Your last comment came during a period of high stress and very clearly did not reflect my reality and I acted badly Please accept my apology and I hope we can move forward communicating more effectively OP is hardcore reading into those comments personally but come on The guy is clearly thinking about himself in the past HIS life got a lot harder when he had kids

relationships|Tue May 15 10:13:01 2018|72|But also you re teaching your daughter an important lesson This isn t just about protecting her but about showing her that you can and should reject abusive emotionally in this case people Think about your own life how long did it take you to start saying no out of a misplaced sense of obligation Frankly I d keep doing what you re doing and maybe use this as a teaching moment 
relationships|Mon May 14 03:49:55 2018|180|Dude no Sexual harassment is illegal What you re experiencing is sexual harassment None of what he s doing is appropriate in the workplace regardless of whether you said no He s doing it because he thinks he can get away with it Show yourself you re stronger than that and report him to HR or your boss Also sexual harassment is one issue but race is a protected class as well I m not sure what his racial comments were but those are illegal too NEVER let him make you feel like you re less than for your race I m 31 If I could tell myself one thing at your age it would be to take the chance and stand up for myself when something was setting off my squicky alarm The earlier you do it the first time the less bullshit you ll put up with over your lifetime One last piece of advice especially important at your age stop saying you never said no and start saying you never said yes He s a fucking creep

relationships|Tue Apr  3 09:17:51 2018|76|He got kicked by a grown man but has no lasting damage You said you checked him out and can t find bruises right But logically a grown angry man kicking a dog should leave damage For your own benefit and the dog s benefit you should take him to the vet to get him checked out but if the vet clears him maybe consider that he really did just trip or step on a tail 
relationships|Tue Apr  3 07:34:06 2018|63|If I lost my son and had the wrong religion thrown at me during such a dark and trying time I would be hurting so much worse afterwards It wouldn t feel like someone cared about my pain only about proselytizing One way you might be able to avoid doing that is to start out by saying Are you Christian If so xxxx 
relationships|Mon Apr  2 13:01:14 2018|171|I m curious how the balance of power works here OP your fiance sucks He s shitty and mean but the reason the kink matters is because it s completely unclear whether he could reasonably think his shittiness is okay within the confines of your relationship fetish But also maybe you should take a look at why you participate in your fetish and the camming that you do I m not fat shaming girl I do not CARE what you look like at all but are you sure you re happy You talk about your insecurity wrt what other people think How often is this the case Is it often enough that you re compensating by love bombing yourself with people who feel the exact opposite of those you re encountering on a daily basis Said another way if you were a size 12 do you think you would still want to participate in this fetish I dunno Something smells off here and I really hope you keep yourself emotionally safe

relationships|Fri Mar 30 10:34:09 2018|130|This isn t the point of your post but asexual isn t the same as aromantic let s say you don t ever find yourself wanting sex in the future that s totally cool You re not alone If you re worried that you won t have romantic love later in life because you need to get over being asexual that s not the case at all On to your actual post if you want to communicate these things to them but are having difficulty finding the words try writing down what you want to say first It can help you organize your thoughts before you go live If you wanted to you could share what you wrote with your parents or you could verbally relate it to them later 
relationships|Thu Mar 15 08:03:50 2018|84|Hey so out of the box suggestion you should take an improv class I agree with others here that the lack of confidence is probably your biggest detriment Improv can specifically address some of your concerns like capturing people s attention and will build your confidence as well as providing a new pool of potential friends Also therapy I know it s a cliche but honestly therapy has helped me see myself the way others see me rather than how I negatively saw myself 
relationships|Wed Mar 14 17:06:49 2018|56| That seems like a very large conclusion to jump to when OP doesn t indicate any reason to suspect Mom would do something like that I agree plus the damage from getting hit by a car is likely pretty different from damage from abuse I assume mom or someone else hit the dog with the car

relationships|Wed Mar  7 12:24:15 2018|77| Anyone here who is saying he s overreacting is being massively insensitive about it how this could affect someone s self esteem I don t love the term overreacting but if this guy is crying and asking the universe what he did to deserve his partner having a past that includes porn I m not really clear on what the gif is the ONLY sensible reaction here is getting out of that relationship Same with OP frankly

relationships|Wed Feb 28 11:44:14 2018|238|Real talk as a non Jewish atheist though woman dating a Jewish man What do you want out of this relationship Do you want this to end in marriage You should talk to him about how he views his religion in the context of your future relationship Completely excluding the homosexuality piece of it marrying someone who isn t also Jewish may not be part of his plans My boyfriend is very secular but he even has issues thinking about our future because of cultural pressures that I still struggle to understand e g his orthodox brother has very explicitly said he and his family would never attend our wedding for example Shit is heartbreaking Separately I once dated a Catholic who prayed after we had sexual activity when I was around your age actually I felt embarrassed and ashamed I put up with it for a few months before I realized that I wasn t willing to take my healthy attitudes towards sex and have them corrupted by someone who was struggling with their sexuality and its relationship to their lifelong religion After we broke up he ended up marrying a Catholic ex girlfriend within a year which helped resolve his sexuality struggle As far as I can tell we re both equally happy in life sometimes beliefs are genuinely incompatible It doesn t make either one of us right or wrong we just didn t work 
relationships|Tue Feb 27 15:26:01 2018|47|I genuinely don t understand how the majority of these comments thus far are supportive of how OP acted Especially for example given how much leeway OP is asking for due to personal circumstances that she is completely unwilling to extend to anyone else also behaving badly

relationships|Fri Dec 22 10:52:54 2017|186|Completely agree about the infantilization I worked as an investment banking associate at a bulge bracket bank up until a year ago i e it sounds like a comparable role to what OP is doing though he may be a VP and being a woman in that industry is HARD The sexism while typically less obvious than it was in years past is there and it is prevalent Though my favorite moment was when a senior individual said that my group provided an objective truth on companies You know like when there s an assault and it turns into a he said she said situation and you re not sure who s in the right Our team helped clear things like that up For all the sexism I experienced there that was the only time I went to HR and it was because I had another woman working under me and I wanted to show her not to put up with that shit OP if you had men working under you would you call them boys Would you call yourself a Papa Bear Use that heuristic
