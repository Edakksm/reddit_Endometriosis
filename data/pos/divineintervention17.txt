relationships|Thu Feb  8 23:18:55 2018|105|I know how you feel OP I have the same thing and have had it all of my life In early primary school I got picked on a little for it and got really self conscious thinking that I d have to wear gloves for the rest of my life or something Now I like to think that they just have a bit of character I guess In any case it s rude for him to say something about a physical feature that you re clearly self conscious about but I d also try to find a way to make peace with how they are 
relationships|Thu Feb  8 10:14:49 2018|142|Usually people aren t always on the defensive going in thinking the worst You know her well I m sure she has good judgement I m sure her partner understands the nature of your platonic friendship A lot of men and women are purely friends it isn t new Just go in thinking that you re going to have drinks with two individuals one that you know well and one that you might really grow to like It s always good to go into a situation with a logical and clear mind If you start noticing that they re blocking you out of conversations or only talking about their memories and experiences and essentially leaving you out or he seems weird with you like he s sizing you up then you could leave but don t assume that these things will happen 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 23:45:05 2018|51|Eh I d propose to either cancel or postpone the project with him and see how he reacts to that over cutting ties with him completely Some friends can t live together some friends can t work together but it doesn t mean that the friendship itself isn t worth it 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 23:22:11 2018|30|This definitely doesn t sound like anything that might happen to a bipolar patient a schizophrenic yes but those symptoms don t go from 0 to 10 in my experience 
relationships|Wed Feb  7 22:50:45 2018|108|If it were me I d talk to the other members of the group and bring this to light with them using the evidence that Connor gave you etc You could even pose it as a question do you think Steve dislikes me on the basis of my race If they think that might be the case and they continue to be neutral I wouldn t bother with them because that s beyond shitty Alternatively Connor might be wrong or only part right and there was something that happened in the past or some other reason why he s cold towards you that they could enlighten you about 
relationships|Wed Jan 31 04:22:56 2018|17|I m straight and too iron deficient to give blood so I can t have cookies anywhere 
relationships|Sun Jan 21 19:30:02 2018|56|What about in your college classes That way the people usually have a common interest Does your college have a bar Bars are a good way to grab a beer or not if you don t drink and be like hey can I take a seat here Just burning time at the college bar or whatever 
relationships|Sat Jan 13 22:15:53 2018|119|I get that there s some childhood trauma there and I get that I don t know him and you can only get so much from one post but he sounds like a very edgy condescending dick to act this way I grew up in a similar way to you so it might be easier said than done but an important aspect of being a person is being open minded and kind regardless of faith or whatever else Him rallying with his friends the snide and stupid comments during documentaries all because you go INTO church really puts me off Does he treat people that are religious like this at parties or just out in the world in general 
relationships|Mon Jan  1 02:15:10 2018|129|I think before you go out searching for true friends you need to look inwardly and work on your own mental health issues I had many friends developed social anxiety and felt like I couldn t talk to even my closest friends I started flaking out on everybody when I was around someone it was almost as if I felt like my facial muscles were contorting and I kept stuttering I went to a psych and through working out the root of my anxiety and some medication overcame it and am now much less anxious Social anxiety is awful and finding friends in your current mindset and with your low self esteem might not be an easy first step Can you afford to see a psychologist around your area 
relationships|Thu Dec 21 06:54:56 2017|17|I am using my friend s account because I did not want to use mine for this 
relationships|Wed Dec 20 10:24:06 2017|15|Me 21 F with my brother 24 M wants to bring his friend to Christmas 
relationships|Sat Dec 16 22:13:50 2017|50|This feels like a troll post just off the bat Second what s the question Third you don t have to stay with somebody that you don t find physically attractive but what you said to her seems harsh af given the circumstances could have found comfort in sex alright 
relationships|Thu Dec 14 07:50:40 2017|47|that s what I m thinking of but my dad has the habit of getting wasted and cornering off people he has an issue with at these events and I just hope to god that doesn t happen because I don t think I can take it 
relationships|Thu Dec 14 05:21:45 2017|8|would that be perceived as ruining christmas though 
relationships|Thu Dec 14 04:38:45 2017|67|I ve never even heard of those I might look into them Mum she would have told him in the hope that he d be supportive because somehow she always hopes for the best result with him however unrealistic I can t really put it on her Honestly I think he s widdled her down a bit over the years and she s weakened to his bullshit 
relationships|Thu Dec 14 01:58:06 2017|108|The thing is I quite like the rest of my family and since my parents moved away I know mum s really sad about seeing me and my brother less I grew up in the city as did they but they bought a hotel and had a sea change after I graduated so we re not a rural family but they don t really believe in mental illness either That sounds really hard I m sorry that you have to go through that I just can t work out whether going for my mum and other family members is a worthwhile sacrifice if I have to face dad 
relationships|Thu Dec 14 01:39:57 2017|26|Me 23 F with my dad 62 M very anxious about seeing him on Christmas due to a phone conversation we had regarding my mental health 
relationships|Tue Dec 12 10:28:13 2017|75|Off topic but I m glad you have great communication with her good job it s so great for your kids Weird that she wouldn t know any more about his possible motivations it could be residual guilt or him wanting to find out information be involved in your life or any thing under the sun really I see no harm in replying and being nice on messenger with him and seeing where it goes 
relationships|Tue Dec 12 10:00:08 2017|19|Do you still have a civil enough relationship with your ex to ask her what might be promoting this 
relationships|Mon Dec 11 10:44:10 2017|16|How do you know that these occurrences in her day to day life are definitively lies 
relationships|Sat Dec  9 09:41:38 2017|35|For sure man I m sorry this happened you re gonna have to have a discussion with your partner about it The results of that discussion vary though but you can t leave it unaddressed 
relationships|Sat Dec  9 08:35:48 2017|125|Oh boy I doubt they were actually friends before he knew her name I mean I know the names of all of my friends haha I ll admit that on this subreddit people usually freak out about their partner s friendships with the opposite sex and I usually think they re being paranoid but this is not normal I d try and have a conversation about whether there s any sexual chemistry between him and this friend referencing your side note because that comment implies that he s turned on by you and this woman in equal measure and maybe not for the same reasons I have many close male friends who I am affectionate to but I would never sexualise them in that way 
relationships|Sat Dec  9 03:25:21 2017|40|The first two could easily be a platonic best friend kinda thing the tell you how I feel part threw me a little More context on the length strength of their friendship Also how long have you been with him 
relationships|Thu Dec  7 05:40:44 2017|39|Hm alright well I guess attempt to talk it through and go from there man if she s not receptive you might decide that the friendship is not worth it if she s not willing to change for it 
relationships|Thu Dec  7 05:05:29 2017|125|Hmm I guess she might be a naturally erratic sensitive somewhat entitled person if she s this way with her sisters too How long does she stay angry I guess it might be a good idea to have a talk with her about it something like you can t always help with these things and her anger upsets you In situations like these where you like and dislike certain attributes in a person you sorta just have to weigh up whether what you like about her and your friendship is good enough to justify the shit you get from her By the way is this thing she wanted you to print out and the excel stuff both related to the subject she s struggling with 
relationships|Thu Dec  7 04:43:07 2017|120|Though I agree with the stuff that the other posters have suggested that her behaviour is childish I think people often forget on this subreddit that relationships are a little more complex than just cut her off honey because she s just someone we know from a single example but she s your friend So a few questions 1 What are some other examples of her picking a petty fight 2 Is there or has there been any hardships or issues with her life that maybe correlate with the amount to which she acts this way 3 What is her relationship like with her family 4 Does she have many other friends 5 How long have you guys been friends 
relationships|Wed Dec  6 08:59:56 2017|29|This is great advice I should have read it before I commented something slightly similar up there somewhere You re honest with each other don t change that now 
relationships|Wed Dec  6 08:56:47 2017|41|the bell can be un ring I believe Now you could say sorry for not explaining that last text or whatever properly but I feel a bit hurt about what I overheard you say about my gift wanna talk it through 
relationships|Wed Dec  6 05:00:40 2017|84|Don t be sorry Being sensitive and overthinking things like friendships has its negative attributes but it also means you re thoughtful and empathetic Usually empaths are anxious people because they can channel other people s feelings really well Why don t you talk to her about wedding planning soon in a way where you re like we ll do it together it ll be a really fun day etc to make it feel casual and relaxed and undo any pressure she might feel 
relationships|Wed Dec  6 04:24:01 2017|56|I m really really sensitive too so its important for us sensitive beings to try not to overthink everything too hard and look at other possibilities It could be that she s freaking out about stepping up to the plate r e maid of honour duties and the present has made the role feel more intense 
relationships|Mon Dec  4 04:18:25 2017|166|Look at this realisation as a blessing You want to travel you want to study and you re not satisfied with your life right now Some people realise this when they re 50 or 60 but you have all the time in the world to make changes Your partner doesn t have to get it because you get it and you know a change is important for you right now What is your current job and what is your dream job Does your country have any kind of economic student support Many universities and colleges offer the opportunity to study abroad for a semester too If you re afraid that you re too old for college don t because that s crazy It s never too late and you re only in your 20s Heaps of student at my university are 40 and my friend just quit his trade to study politics at 25 and he says it s the best thing he s ever done 
relationships|Mon Dec  4 04:08:20 2017|52|It doesn t sound like you want to be rid of the friendship completely like you enjoy this dude s company and just not the one sidedness travel time Why don t you suggest hitting up a bar or seeing a movie or something that s in between where you both live
