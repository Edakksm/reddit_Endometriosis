TwoXChromosomes|Wed Oct  4 14:53:37 2017|18|Didn t say you had to do anything you mentioned Just pointing out what the Redpillers themselves claim 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 18:42:05 2017|31|On days I am fertile but I extend that six days on either end of the fertile window so basically it ends up being the whole month with condoms on haha 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 16:59:33 2017|53|Crazy how many people with stories just like ours I feel like the pill is really pushed as the only option and it s great that it works for so many people but not once did my doc suggest anything else even after years of horrible migraines and far too many med changes 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 16:47:22 2017|66|God I felt so stupid when I started reading about it and was like I ve spent how many years not knowing real basic things about my body I went to a super strict catholic school so no sex ed and I was put on the pill at 14 so I never really had to learn It s like a whole new world out there haha
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 16:33:55 2017|65|That s amazing I was on meds for migraines and bipolar disorder before quitting HBC Now I don t need either It s insane how much of an impact it can have on you I comment on every birth control post now just to yell about fertility awareness haha I wish I would have known sooner but am so happy to be using it now 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 15:04:36 2017|29|This is why you also use condoms But it s been working great for me Just have to do your research and take the time to do it right 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 14:51:53 2017|17|I ve been reading it off and on for a few months and never seen that once 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 14:41:56 2017|42|The redpill generally speaking is about improving yourself and accepting women for who they are Some crazies hang out there too but from what I ve seen the regular users call out the dudes who are trying to foster hate towards women 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct  3 14:38:00 2017|74|I don t use any hormonal birth control I track my cycle using fertility awareness and we use condoms It s different for everyone but going off the pill has made my quality of life so much better and using condoms tracking hasn t put a damper on our sex life If anything it has helped us grow closer because we have to talk more about it and make sure we are being safe 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Sep 21 21:58:58 2017|27|There is A LOT to it I would recommend reading up on it and talking to your doctor before using it There are many pros and cons 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Sep 21 20:53:20 2017|82|I am 22 young ish but I wouldn t have trusted my 16 year old self to use FAM I also wouldn t have used this method with any of my previous partners My current partner is very involved and I trust completely not to whip off the condom or something Anyone who wouldn t be able to deal with a baby or having an abortion shouldn t rely on just FAM But it s nice to know it is an option 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Sep 21 20:48:38 2017|6|I don t understand your joke
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Sep 21 20:44:19 2017|106|Myself and my partner do use condoms pulling out rather frequently so I m sure that makes it a little more effective but within the community I ve found lots of people have success even without extra precautions as long as you are extremely attentive and careful I think the thing is that you have to be prepared for the worst and you have to work at it a lot to be comfortable only relying on FAM It s definitely not for everyone but it works so well for me and I wish I would have learned about it before spending 7 years on the pill 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Sep 21 20:29:30 2017|32|I do not want to be pregnant and have no intentions of becoming pregnant but if it were to happen I would have my baby if that is what you are asking 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Sep 21 20:25:49 2017|90|It actually works really well if you are patient and dedicated I went off birth control and switched to FAM fertility awareness method and it has changed my life Birth control was easy and didn t require any work so I miss that but I feel great about my body and FAM works really well for me I would recommend reading Taking Charge of Your Fertility before making any decisions and do lots of research PM me if you want any more details from someone who is actively using it 
TwoXChromosomes|Thu Sep 14 14:19:07 2017|80|I stopped my birth control pill about six weeks ago I feel so so SO much better My period has yet to return but so far no negative side effects My skin is essentially the same a little bit more oily but my libido is higher I don t have bad bloating anymore and my mood is so much better There s lots of horror stories about quitting but it s the best decision I ve ever made so far 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Aug 28 16:12:57 2017|155|It was a little weird at first but all the guys were great and we had lots of fun I quit after a few months because unfortunately the owner of the company thought it would be real funny to never pay me properly I think he thought he could pull the wool over my eyes because I was so young The dealership ended up going out of business for the second time under that owner a few months later I didn t get back into it because I d been doing sales door to door and jewelry before car for a few years and was kinda burnt out I sometimes wish I could go back It s lots of fun Once you get comfortable using some of the techniques you will have a blast Closing a sale is about the most fun you can have on a job and sales skills transfer over to anywhere 
TwoXChromosomes|Mon Aug 28 14:45:40 2017|122|I worked as the only female sales person when I was 19 at a dealership full of 40 year old men I found that most people didn t realize I was in sales so I could get a rapport going before they stopped trusting me haha It worked in my advantage As far as sales techniques go they are the same for men and women Talk as much about anything but the car as possible mirror their energy focus on three things they want in a vehicle and point them out during the test drive Make sure the customer feels you are on their side of the sale and working for them not your boss Objection handle close the sale Good luck

relationships|Wed Oct 25 13:07:13 2017|53|Hmm damn just trying to think of a way that doesn t involve you having to tell your dad I doubt this guy is ever going to quit sending the videos to that number There s no reason for him to stop and he s a sick dude that getsoff on humiliating you 
relationships|Wed Oct 25 12:58:15 2017|36|Is there any way you can get your dad to change his number Say someone online is harassing you and going to bring your family into it and you all need to change your numbers asap 
relationships|Wed Oct  4 15:01:59 2017|79|Hmm maybe like many others from what I ve read he feels like he should be happy because it s amazing time of your lives and he doesn t want to make you feel bad if he s depressed Could be time to dig deeper Maybe he doesn t realize how big of an issue it is Regardless whatever the issue turns out to be I hope you two can resolve it and continue your happy life Good luck 
relationships|Wed Oct  4 13:18:47 2017|43|Male postpartum depression I don t know much about it so I ll leave it at that but maybe ask how he is coping with this new life and bring it up with a doctor if he thinks this could be the issue 
relationships|Tue Oct  3 13:23:16 2017|58|Now that you aren t drinking you will have more time and more money to do different things Maybe you could try to get into a hobby or sport together or go on a weekend vacay Big or small doing something new and exciting with your husband would be a great way to show your appreciation and love 
relationships|Tue Sep 26 13:07:16 2017|95|I think you should delete them off your Facebook but definitely save them to an external hard drive or USB I deleted every photo of myself and my ex after we broke up two years of travelling Australia and Canada together and now I have nothing to show of my big adventure It sucks big time that I don t have photos of those memories of life abroad Now that I have moved on from the relationship I wish I still had photos of my old room the beach the van we lived in etc 
relationships|Wed Sep 20 12:14:43 2017|12|But then you gotta just keep watching because it s a classic 
relationships|Tue Sep 19 16:44:42 2017|7|Make them watch Pulp Fiction with you
