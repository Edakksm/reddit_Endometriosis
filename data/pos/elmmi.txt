relationships|Mon Feb 12 11:11:50 2018|240|Well I can really recommend that you together sit down and talk Talk to eachother about how the disease is making both of you feel If it is this you want to be with her that is She has to accept that its gonna be there for the rest of her life So is the medication You also have to accept that she will never be 100 healthy ever again And I know its easy to say that you have accepted it but you might still need someone who is professional to talk to about it Then the other thing What can you do TOGETHER to make it better How can you help each other out what things can you go out and do that doesnt take as much energy but still is fun And third and the hardest She might not be aware of it and neither you but you need to fight constantly seek help from the doctors a LOT to find the right kind of treatment for her The right kind of pain medication that can make her daily life better Its a struggle but it also makes you appreciate those days so much more But still don t stay because you feel like its something you have to do You are young she is too Its up to you what you want and how much energy you want to put into the relationship Much love Elmmi
