relationships|Thu Jan 25 12:53:20 2018|66|100 no doubt tell him It was insane of your MIL to put you in that position Your loyalties are to your husband not to her psycho dysfunctional relationship Also it s pretty weird that your MIL is your best friend If that ever puts you in a conflicted situation again you d better damn well choose your husband s best interests He is your family 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 12:46:38 2018|50|I m glad you re trying for the sake of your child And it s great to address her 1 pain point Just be very clear that verbal abuse and name calling are not acceptable things in your marriage If she starts doing that exist the conversation and stop engaging 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 12:31:01 2018|145| and if you lose feelings you should let them know immediately so they are not still falling in love with youWhen you are young and dating yes But this isn t realistic within the context of a long term committed relationship As you grow in life people fundamentally change and your resulting feelings about them shift as well And sometimes it takes time to see whether you can recover the feelings whether you can adapt to the shift and recover the romance again I ve been married 15 years so I know a little about this The key to staying together for a long period is learning how to fall back in love with your partner But the period that your feelings are more confused aren t a period where you are leading them on It s a period where you re figuring stuff out 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 12:28:34 2018|103|So I m a child of divorce My parents tried to stay together for two decades Two miserable decades where I watched them fight hate each other disrespect each other and both of them be insanely unhappy They were miserable years for me as well When they finally bit the bullet and divorced EVERYTHING improved in my family It s amazing what having happy parents that are modeling healthy relationships does to transform your perception of the world as a kid It is far more important than keeping the family together for the kids which is a fundamentally broken notion Just my 02 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 12:12:48 2018|36|Ultrasounds can t show a baby until the 6th or 7th week and most obs will not do them until the 9th week and that s to check for health of baby not to diagnose pregnancy 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 12:01:36 2018|28| I was called some unkind things for even suggesting it You were verbally abused for suggesting a solution You have bigger problems in your marriage than just chores 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 12:00:49 2018|42|Yes except an ultrasound is not what the doctor does to confirm conception They do a more accurate HcG test urine or blood than the drugstore has You re spreading inaccurate info We are just correcting you and you are getting hostile 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 11:56:04 2018|83|Get a divorce Monogamy is not for everybody and it definitely sounds like it isn t for you It s okay to not have a normal life It s time to accept that your life is going to be a little different But it s too late to back out we re married No it s really not and you need to back out as soon as humanly possible You re pretty much acting about as horribly as you can to another person 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 11:53:57 2018|19|No pregnancy test claims to be 100 accurate Because they aren t And ultrasounds are not a pregnancy test

relationships|Thu Jan 25 11:45:06 2018|45|While I agree that she shouldn t delay any further I really don t think it s fair to characterize what OP is doing as leading him on She s hoping he finds a way back to who he was and respecting his grieving process 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 11:43:15 2018|111|You have been in an abusive relationship a long time It is SEVERE Make a plan Figure out where you can go move back in with your parents or with a friend or to a domestic violence shelter Make transportation arrangements When he s gone gather your things your child s things and all important paperwork like birth certificates vaccination records passports any deeds you have etc and leave Do not leave a note and do not tell him where you are going At that point you will want to start the process for child support Document any abusive behavior so that you can build a case to protect your kid

relationships|Thu Jan 25 10:43:20 2018|43|Dude the relationship is over You need to dump her and move on And consider dating women that aren t ten years younger than you You ll find that with more maturity they are less likely to cheat that goes for both genders

relationships|Thu Jan 25 10:40:34 2018|72|It does suck but remember if this is something to do with anxiety it means she s in a really bad place right now She likely doesn t want to ruin your relationship but literally doesn t have the mental health to do otherwise It doesn t mean you have to sit around and wait for her to get better but don t feel like this is entirely in her control either 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 10:39:05 2018|105|Absolutely DO NOT RESPOND to Louisa Your entire goal here is to not put yourself in her crosshairs while she s rampaging Mark everything she sends you as junk and put it in a folder to save later if restraining orders are necessary But DO NOT respond to anything Block her on all of your social media if you haven t done so already It doesn t matter if she notices your goal is to protect yourself right now Your dad should consider contracting a lawyer to send her a cease and desist letter since she s spamming all of his friends with defamatory accusations 
relationships|Thu Jan 25 10:15:59 2018|44|Does she have any anxiety If she s riding an anxiety high she might not be able to deal with the stress spotlight of being a bridesmaid and then is also feeling so guilty bad about declining that she is avoiding being around you 
relationships|Fri Jan 12 16:47:36 2018|41|Sit down with your father and describe these experiences that you ve had with your mom Her reactions are not normal and are probably indicative of PPD postpartum depression which can raise anxiety and protectiveness of your baby to abnormal levels

relationships|Fri Jan 12 16:42:06 2018|75| I m not asking her to be my best friend or to even ask me anything about my personal life Except you are Literally half your post was describing your car accident and how she didn t ask you how you were feeling So don t come back and claim that this is all about professional matters It s not entirely There s a super big dose of your hurt feelings interwoven into this post 
relationships|Fri Jan 12 15:37:05 2018|12|It s not harassment Not in any kind of legal sense whatsoever 
relationships|Fri Jan 12 15:36:48 2018|20|It s not harassment Not asking how somebody is after a car crash is not harassment Your statement is ridiculous 
relationships|Fri Jan 12 15:35:57 2018|144|You re overreacting frankly While she isn t nice to you she isn t actually being overtly unkind or cruel So she doesn t ask you how you are after your car accident and it s the end of the world Please This is not a hostile work environment It s not even close You need to deal with the fact that not everybody at work is going to like you It sounds like the people pleasing person in this instance is in fact YOU and not Mary because you can t handle the fact that she doesn t like you much It s okay for her not to like you as long as it doesn t significantly negatively impact the work If you can t handle it go get another job But there s nothing significantly wrong here for your manager to correct

relationships|Mon Oct  9 16:12:54 2017|249|Here s what I think is happening your parents are worried about you your dad in particular because you are 17 and have never shown any interest in dating I know that seems weird but parents worry about that stuff They worry about whether you are okay happy well adjusted and whether you ll die alone and even whether you ll give them grandkids Your dad assumes hopes that you must be dating and hiding it and that you are okay after all He s crossing boundaries to try to find out Which is not okay but I don t think his intentions are full on malicious From everything you ve written here I don t think the possibility that you are gay has crossed his mind The best way to handle this situation is to be honest with your parents I think that your dad s concern and actions may only escalate until you actually come clean to them about your sexuality The benefits of doing so are you get to live a more authentic life and they get to stop worrying about why you re not dating and whether you re going to die alone Increasing honesty is going to increase trust Given everything you ve said about your dad I m not sure he ll take your coming out well initially But at least if he doesn t he ll be freaking out about something that is real instead of imaginary girlfriends that don t exist

relationships|Mon Oct  9 13:54:58 2017|136|Show up at his office one of the nights he is working late with a picnic of some food for him to show your appreciation for his hard work This will allow you to confirm whether he s really at work or not If he is at work he s just stressed Later have a talk with him about the distance between you and how you guys can improve it If he s not then you have a problem He helps companies earn money and all that jazz too confusing for me to ever understand Consider getting some additional education Sales manager jobs are definitely not too hard for you to understand and it sounds like you re selling yourself short You don t want to be dependent on your husband if things go to shit
