AskWomen|Thu Aug 24 22:45:55 2017|211|i m not a professional photographer but i do hobby photography photography is waaay more work than people think first of all to get professional looking photos you need a lot of expensive equipment some people learn on their own but most pro photags have some sort of training education also money editing software is expensive the time it takes to edit photos can be very long especially larger sets of photos that need to have cohesive tones colors which is actually much harder than you think as lighting fluctuates throughout the day and location again i m not a pro but it can take me upwards of 2 hours to edit like a dozen photos and it requires a certain level of skill people deserve to be compensated fairly for that time also travel time gas car expenses whatever estimate you get is to help pay for the training equipment and time that goes into your photos extras should cost extra you don t go to the grocery store and say this can of beans cost 2 it should really come with something else at that price do you no the can of beans costs 2 that s how much it costs not how much the can extras would cost

AskWomen|Mon Jul 24 14:18:03 2017|42| ASOIAF is simply not one of those storiesthe point is that there is NO legitimate reason for it not to be one of those stories especially in this day and age except that the creators have some fucked up fantasies about women 
AskWomen|Mon Jul 24 14:15:25 2017|75|yes the show is racist and as another commenter pointed out it s not a historically accurate show it s fantasy like lord of the rings so there really isn t an excuse for it to be misogynistic and the show is misogynistic beyond the usual not having strong female leads which i guess this show kinda does but that it frequently portrays violence against women and everybody accepts it as normal even the victims
