TwoXChromosomes|Tue Apr 10 12:15:29 2018|53|I actually really enjoy waxing so I do it but only on my coarse dark hairs I don t shave otherwise except for an event and it s barely noticeable even though my legs are still covered in hair Definitely I didn t waste so much time shaving for all of those years
TwoXChromosomes|Wed Dec 27 10:40:39 2017|118|If your period was about to start you shouldn t have been fertile There is only a 2 day window after ovulation where the egg can be fertilized But sperm can live for 2 weeks which is why protection is necessary most of the time Also changes to ovulation your cycle could change when ovulation occurs so it s not perfect But for a textbook 28 day cycle you ovulate on day 14 and theoretically could only get pregnant if you had sex between days 1 16 Any sex days 17 28 will not result in pregnancy because the oocyte degenerates Obviously this is just an example and everyone is different but hopefully this eases your concerns somewhat

TwoXChromosomes|Sat Dec 16 10:47:53 2017|82|A good haircut needs a good stylist But it also needs frequent cuts sometimes monthly Yes it does grow back but it sounds like you won t be able to grow it out for a long time if it has to be above the collar I can t imagine growing out my hair and being able to keep it up and neat at an intermediate length So I d personally consider this a 100 commitment may be different for other hair textures

AskWomen|Fri Dec 22 10:11:19 2017|16|Here is a short podcast that explains what I was talking about in much more detail 
AskWomen|Wed Dec 20 22:18:53 2017|110|Don t get hung up on the headlines and remember if it sounds too good to be true it probably is Scientific studies are simplified for press releases which are interpreted and further simplified through media and they make completely false statements by misinterpreting the study It s even less helpful that they almost never cite the original study so it s difficult impossible to find whether the popular science article was real or not So stick to regular exercise and eat mindfully whatever that means to you And ask yourself whether the source of any new information is trustworthy before making any decisions about your health lifestyle including reddit 
AskWomen|Wed Dec 20 22:09:25 2017|15|And remember that a good portion of your water needs are met through your food
