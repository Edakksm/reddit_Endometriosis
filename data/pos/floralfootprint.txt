relationships|Wed Nov 22 12:01:46 2017|89|Honestly I have no advice I just wanted to say I am incredibly sorry for your loss I have a pair of leather chairs from my late grandfather that are not only priceless but hold incredible personal value to me I would be devastated if anything happened to them especially at the hands of my partner who also knows how important these chairs are to me and my family I am so so sorry and hope you find a safe way to cope Sending you love and positive vibes
