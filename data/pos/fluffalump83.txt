TwoXChromosomes|Fri Nov 17 07:53:48 2017|85|I m also in my twenties married and we have a small child Morning sex is awesome Yes it s a little sleepier and not necessarily as passionate as things could normally be but sometimes comfortable is nice Being at the comfort level to be intimate with someone first thing in the morning and still feel like you re number one even if you don t have a lot of time is one of the best feelings in the world I would definitely recommend it 
TwoXChromosomes|Tue Oct 17 03:33:52 2017|197|I ve been feeling this a lot today because I was talking to my husband and trying to think and I ve only had two major relationships and they ve never been pushy and besides that I don t get hit on when I go out and I don t notice people looking at me though my husband says he hard stares people down sometimes because they won t quit I actually did remember though that I repressed and incident when I was younger my first sexual experience I offered to give a guy I liked a blow job because I didn t think it was a big deal My feelings were not reciprocated and he tried to make up for the fact that I had no idea what I was doing by repeatedly forcing his dick to the back of my throat and pushing down on my head My husband considers that sexual assault when I brought it up to him but I have issues because I didn t stop him and I was the one that brought up the blow job and said I would so am I really allowed to be upset about it

AskWomen|Thu Oct 26 02:21:28 2017|82|Idk if it would have mattered or if stepping stones actually work I had to push an almost 8 pound baby out for sex to stop being painful with my husband and I was with other guys before him but him being the biggest was always an issue I had and have endometriosis and I also had surgery but even after surgery I still feel like it was painful until after birth so I really feel like it was a size thing
