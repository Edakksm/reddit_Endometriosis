relationships|Sun Aug 13 05:54:54 2017|34|Wtf I never compared weed to gum It was just a thought exercise to show that the legal addiction impairment stuff was beside the point You re right this argument is going nowhere Cheers 
relationships|Sun Aug 13 05:28:26 2017|320|Yeah but my point is that op is being told that she is just uptight about mj and needs to smoke a blunt and she spends a lot of time justifying her attitude toward weed Even if weed was legal Even if he wasn t an addict Even if he was obsessed with something that wouldn t ever get him fired fined charged or incarcerated they re still incompatible She still did the right thing by breaking up You can break up with anyone for any reason and being obsessed with something I have no interest in is a good reason to break up with someone regardless of what that something is If OP was dating someone obsessed with gym mma music or sex and OP didn t want to talk about gym mma music or sex then breaking up is still the correct move OP doesn t need to justify herself and feel like she has to justify her I don t do it but you do you stance toward marijuana The people telling her she needs to smoke a blunt and relax are wrong The people telling her to give the guy another chance because it is just weed are wrong The people telling her that people can t be addicted to weed or can t be dangerous on weed are wrong We don t know the depths of this dude s addiction we don t know him My point is that it doesn t matter He doesn t have to have a problematic relationship with weed but it 100 sounds like he does for OP to be justified in breaking up Even if he didn t have a problematic relationship with an illegal substance Him talking about something anything and doing something anything which bothers OP and refusing to stop when he is around her is 1000 enough of a reason to break up Good work OP 
relationships|Sun Aug 13 05:00:53 2017|61|I am just saying that it doesn t matter what the thing is It could be smoking a joint it could be chewing gum it could be collecting stamps If a dude is obsessed with something and won t shut up about it for 2 seconds then he is the wrong dude for a lady who doesn t like that thing 
relationships|Sun Aug 13 03:51:06 2017|224|Imagine that your ex was obsessed with something that wasn t illegal Say chewing gum But the sight or sound of someone chewing gum makes you irrationally angry You know that there is nothing wrong with chewing gum and you aren t morally opposed to it You just hate it And your boyfriend always has to be chewing gum And he refuses to stop while he is around you And it is alllllll he talks about The latest and greatest flavours It is STILL okay for you to break up with him Even though chewing gum is absolutely fine and normal and maybe you re just a bit uptight about it If you hate chewing gum then a guy who is obsessed with chewing gum is the wrong guy There are plenty of guys out there who chew normal amounts of gum There are guys who don t chew gum Maybe gum guy is a great guy and will find someone who also loves gum OP even if your friends are right and you need to chill about weed ftr I think they re wrong and weed is stinky and gross this is still the wrong relationship for you There are plenty of dudes that aren t completely obsessed with weed Find someone who can hold a conversation about something that actually interests you

relationships|Sun Jul 30 22:29:06 2017|352|I used to have a really weird reaction to the concept of blood Like you it wasn t a phobia in the traditional sense I wasn t afraid and wouldn t have a panic attack or anything Actual blood was usually fine My own period blood was fine But if people were discussing their blood type Or talking about donating blood I would feel super light headed and nauseated and prickly all over I learned to react in a very specific way not making like a big deal out of it but not in a joking way which lead even friends to tease me about it which would set me off but just try and display my unease and queasiness Of course usually I would just excuse myself from the conversation and do something else or go to the bathroom and request that the subject be changed before I get back if I was sitting at a dinner table or something But when questioned on it I would just say yeah it s weird and I can t talk about it but it just makes me feel really bad and unpleasant and if someone said haha that is so funny blooood blooood bloood I would just look them in the eye and say it really isn t They would always apologise immediately and never did it again It is possible that some of these people don t understand the depth of your torment because it is weird And you possibly try and laugh it off so they think it is funny to tease you And you shouldn t have to manage your reaction to things and you should just be treated with respect but this did help with my weird thing 1 Eye contact2 Neutral Flat voice3 This isn t actually funny to me or this isn t fun for me PS My weird thing about blood resolved itself when I started on stimulants when I was diagnosed with ADHD in my 30s That is the only reason I can talk about it at all now Weird huh Brains are so weird 
relationships|Sun Jul 30 07:03:20 2017|91|I moved in with an ex after 2 years and we broke up immediately I think we could have dated another 2 years and moved in together and we still would have broken up as soon as we shared a living space Everyone is different of course but it makes sense to me that if you want to be with and build a life with someone you you know do that Taking things slowly doesn t help you build a strong relationship with someone if you aren t doing any building 
relationships|Sat Jul 29 18:55:53 2017|186|Before we got married my husband and I agreed we wanted two children My husband was very against having an only child as he thought it important for our kid to have siblings My planned c section was lovely But my pregnancy was horrible I had morning sickness the whole time and it was just awful When our son was a newborn I was talking to my husband and i told him how scared I was of another pregnancy and asked him how he would feel about not having any more children given that he was so against having an only child Do you know what he said He said we should just concentrate on the kid we have now and together we could decide what to do later Because having two kids wasn t a promise I made him it was a decision we made together It isn t some kind of contract It is something you decide on or undecide on as a team And as the one who has to do all the hard work of pregnancy you definitely get first veto power

relationships|Tue Jul 11 06:35:16 2017|298|I always intended to live with someone before marriage It just seemed ridiculous and foolish not to I moved in with a guy when I was in my early 20s after almost 2 years of dating We broke up almost immediately Looking back at the relationship we probably could have dated for another couple of years but as soon as we moved in together we would have broken up In close quarters we just did NOT work This experience further cemented my intention of never marrying someone I hadn t lived with So after that I dated someone else and he didn t want us to live together before we got married so I didn t move in with him until after the wedding And even though I had always thought I wouldn t do such a thing and even with prior experience telling me that living together before marriage was an excellent idea when it came down to it I just had absolutely no doubt that he was the person I wanted to marry and spend the rest of my life with and I didn t think I needed a trial period because I was already sure And we have been married for half a decade now and sure like any couple I can t know for sure that we will last forever I know that moving in together earlier would have been a lot of south Asian parent stress and bother that I am really glad I didn t have to deal with So basically I no longer think that waiting until after marriage to move in is the most ridiculous thing ever although I would still recommend it in most cases For sure have sex though You do NOT want to gamble on sexual compatibility 
relationships|Tue Jul 11 03:29:43 2017|65|Honestly when you first described wanting to break up because you want to be alone for a while I thought yes that is a great reason to break up You are young Learn about yourself and what you want Go for it But the more you write about this guy the more I think holy shit just t get out of this shitty relationship already

relationships|Thu Jun  8 05:24:52 2017|63|A 150ml glass of wine is 1 4 standard drinks Less of a problem than the asshole husband but drinking every single day is not good and let s be real probably a symptom of how much pressure she is under from the asshole husband She should leave him and then she can work out if her drinking is is still a problem

relationships|Mon Jun  5 04:08:20 2017|298|I saw red reading your comment Your husband is being extremely insensitive and pressuring you into sex which is not going to help your issues It sounds to me like you are having a perfectly normal reaction to past trauma Intrusive thoughts and flashbacks can come up at any time Even 20 years after my sexual assault I am sometimes hit by an image of something that happened to me seemingly out of nowhere Over the years I have gotten to a place where I can generally dismiss those thoughts and images and not become disabled by them But I have had a lot of time and a lot of therapy and what happened to me was nowhere near as violent as what you experienced First you need therapy Not because you are mentally ill or because there is something wrong with you but because you have had some traumatic events that you need some help to work through and process so that they don t take over and control you Second your husband is being an absolute asshole about this My first impulse is to tell you to get out of this manipulative relationship so that you can heal and find someone more supportive and less of a jerk But I am pretty sure you aren t ready to hear that right now and maybe he has his own insecurities around sex that are conflicting badly with your trauma Maybe he needs to come along to a therapy session or two and have the therapist explain that yes this is a normal reaction to trauma and help him be more supportive and less rapey I don t use this term lightly If only one person wants I be having the sex then guess what that s rape

relationships|Mon May 15 00:07:47 2017|83|If the problem was her being asexual then you could try and find a solution that works opening the relationship discussing what sex acts if any she is comfortable with masturbation etc etc But her a sexuality is irrelevant here because it sounds like she is a mean and demanding person who doesn t like or respect you very much My suggestion would be to tell her you need space to sort yourself out after your relationship and go no contact Good luck 
relationships|Sun May 14 19:28:51 2017|145|Your boyfriend assaulted you Pimples don t need popping It can lead to infection and scarring Even if they did need popping you could do it yourself or ask him to help you But seriously don t pop them it can lead to infection and scarring But it doesn t matter what it was that your boyfriend wanted to do Say he wanted to boop your nose and you said no I don t want you to boop my nose and he held you down and booped your nose against your will What if next time he doesn t want to pop your pimple Say he wanted to kiss you Say he wanted to fondle you Say he wanted to have sex with you If you say no and he does it anyway Your boyfriend has no respect for your boundaries or your bodily autonomy
