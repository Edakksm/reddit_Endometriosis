relationships|Sat May 19 08:51:45 2018|126|I just want to comment specifically on the pregnancy portion of your husband s point as someone who recently had a baby I this probably applies to a lot of people was definitely in a better emotional state while pregnant than in the months proceeding having my child those months were the most emotional sleep deprived unrational months of our lives The amount your hormones get messed up post birth and during breastfeeding is no joke Even the most stable marriages experience some strain when you throw in a newborn and new responsibilities in the mic Rekindling a delicate family relationship would not be something I recommend starting immediately post baby If I were you I would continue to get to know your brother again now
